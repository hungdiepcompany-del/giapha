## 2026-06-29 - A-15C2 - Supabase Auth Browser Session Binding Diagnostics recorded

- Marker: `A15C2_SUPABASE_AUTH_BROWSER_SESSION_BINDING_DIAGNOSTICS`.
- Added `docs/PLAN_A15C2_SUPABASE_AUTH_BROWSER_SESSION_BINDING_DIAGNOSTICS.md`.
- Added `scripts/smoke-a15c2-auth-browser-session-binding-diagnostics.cjs`,
  `scripts/check-a15c2-supabase-auth-browser-session-binding-diagnostics.cjs`,
  package commands `smoke:a15c2:supabase-auth-browser-session-binding-diagnostics`
  and `check:a15c2:supabase-auth-browser-session-binding-diagnostics`.
- A-15C remains PASS at DB/auth/profile/role/permission readiness:
  `OWNER_ADMIN_PERMISSION_READY_READ_ONLY`, `ROLE_COUNT=1`,
  `PERMISSION_COUNT=25`, `REQUIRED_ADMIN_PERMISSION_MISSING_COUNT=0`.
- A-15B1 remains FAIL at browser session binding: `/admin` redirects to
  `/auth/login?reason=auth_session_missing`; admin shell can render unauthenticated
  routes with unknown user, no role and 0 permissions.
- Static code diagnostics: login/callback/logout routes exist, callback has
  `exchangeCodeForSession`, login redirects to `/auth/callback`, server client
  uses cookie-backed `createServerClient`, and no `middleware.ts` auth guard exists.
- Diagnostic status: `PARTIAL`; reason:
  `AUTH_FLOW_STATIC_PRESENT_BROWSER_SESSION_NOT_BOUND`.
- Next step: owner should confirm Supabase Dashboard URL config for
  `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` and perform a manual owner/admin login
  trace without sharing cookie values. If callback/cookie binding is wrong in
  code, open A-15C3; if the browser context simply was not logged in, rerun A-15B
  style smoke as A-15B2 with a real session.
- No UI polish, mutation, seed, role assignment, schema/RLS/auth/permission/API/
  service runtime change, dependency, `.env.local` commit, deploy or push.

## 2026-06-29 - A-15B1 - Authenticated Admin Heritage UI Browser Smoke Rerun completed

- Marker: `A15B1_AUTHENTICATED_ADMIN_HERITAGE_UI_BROWSER_SMOKE_RERUN`.
- Added `docs/PLAN_A15B1_AUTHENTICATED_ADMIN_HERITAGE_UI_BROWSER_SMOKE_RERUN.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-a15b1-authenticated-admin-heritage-ui-browser-smoke-rerun.cjs`
  and package command
  `check:a15b1:authenticated-admin-heritage-ui-browser-smoke-rerun`.
- A-15C readiness was rerun and PASS:
  `READINESS_REASON=OWNER_ADMIN_PERMISSION_READY_READ_ONLY`, `ROLE_COUNT=1`,
  `PERMISSION_COUNT=25`, `REQUIRED_ADMIN_PERMISSION_MISSING_COUNT=0`.
- Browser rerun used a fresh local dev server at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Browser session result: `FAIL_AUTH_SESSION_NOT_BOUND`; `/admin` still
  redirected to `/auth/login?reason=auth_session_missing!`.
- Admin shell result: `FAIL_UNKNOWN_USER_ROLE_PERMISSION_ZERO`; rendered admin
  routes still showed `Người dùng: Không rõ`, `Vai trò: Chưa có vai trò`,
  `Số quyền: 0`.
- Route matrix: `/tree` PASS; `/people/[slug]`
  `SAFE_SKIP_NO_PUBLICLY_VISIBLE_PROFILE`; `/admin` FAIL auth session not bound;
  `/admin/genealogy`, `/admin/tree/edit`, `/admin/people/new`,
  `/admin/relationships`, `/admin/people/[id]` PARTIAL read-only render.
- Desktop/mobile: no horizontal overflow observed on opened routes.
- No form submit, no mutation, no seed, no role assignment, no dependency, no
  runtime/service/schema change and no push.
- Next retry condition: bind a real owner/admin browser session on localhost and
  rerun A-15B1 route matrix.

## 2026-06-29 - A-15C - Owner/Admin Session Permission Smoke Readiness recorded

- Marker: `A15C_OWNER_ADMIN_SESSION_PERMISSION_SMOKE_READINESS`.
- Added `docs/PLAN_A15C_OWNER_ADMIN_SESSION_PERMISSION_SMOKE_READINESS.md`.
- Added `scripts/smoke-a15c-owner-admin-session-permission-readiness.cjs`,
  `scripts/check-a15c-owner-admin-session-permission-smoke-readiness.cjs`,
  package commands `smoke:a15c:owner-admin-session-permission-readiness` and
  `check:a15c:owner-admin-session-permission-smoke-readiness`.
- Result: `READINESS_STATUS=PASS`,
  `READINESS_REASON=OWNER_ADMIN_PERMISSION_READY_READ_ONLY`.
- This is SELECT/read-only readiness only; it proves DB auth/profile/role/
  permission readiness, not browser cookie/session binding.

## 2026-06-28 - A-15B - Authenticated Heritage UI Browser Smoke completed

- Marker: `A15B_AUTHENTICATED_HERITAGE_UI_BROWSER_SMOKE`.
- Added `docs/PLAN_A15B_AUTHENTICATED_HERITAGE_UI_BROWSER_SMOKE.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-a15b-authenticated-heritage-ui-browser-smoke.cjs` and
  package command `check:a15b:authenticated-heritage-ui-browser-smoke`.
- Browser smoke ran read-only on local `http://localhost:3100`; no form submit,
  no mutation, no auth/permission/API/service/runtime/schema change and no
  browser/session artifact was saved.
- Public result: `/tree` is `PASS` on desktop/mobile with no horizontal overflow,
  public read-only Vietnamese copy and safe CTAs. `/people/[slug]` is
  `SAFE_SKIP_NO_PUBLICLY_VISIBLE_PROFILE` because no public/anon-readable
  profile was available for safe route smoke.
- Auth/session result: `/admin` redirects to login with
  `auth_session_missing!`, so a real owner/admin authenticated smoke was not
  available in this browser session.
- Admin result: `/admin/genealogy`, `/admin/tree/edit`, `/admin/people/new`,
  `/admin/people/[id]` and `/admin/relationships` rendered read-only without
  horizontal overflow, but only as `PARTIAL` because the admin shell showed
  `Người dùng: Không rõ`, `Vai trò: Chưa có vai trò`, `Số quyền: 0`.
- Next retry condition: run the same A-15B route matrix with an explicit safe
  owner/admin browser session if the project owner wants full authenticated PASS.

  card grouping for family, cha/mẹ, con and vợ/chồng relationships, with clear
  warnings that relation changes may affect the phả đồ.

  context and privacy/help text for `Thêm người thân`.
- Boundary confirmed: UI/UX-only; no DB/schema/migration/seed/RLS/auth/
  permission/API/service runtime, no validation contract change, no route
  creation, no public tree/dashboard/member profile redo, no dependency, no
  deploy and no push.

  `Quản trị gia phả` link. No new public routes were created.
- Viewer toolbar remains read-only and keeps search, zoom, fit and reset/căn
  giữa actions; it does not add editor actions or layout persistence.

- No external website image/logo/asset was copied or added.
- `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.

## 2026-06-27 - A-15A1 - Public Home Modern Heritage UI completed

- Applied Gemini Modern Heritage / Di sản Hiện đại polish to Public Home only.
- Changed `components/public/public-home.tsx` and
  `components/layout/public-shell.tsx`.
- Inspected home route `app/(public)/page.tsx`; no route/query/runtime logic was
  changed.
- Public Home now uses warm paper `bg-stone-50`, `text-stone-900`,
  `text-stone-600`, teal primary CTA `bg-teal-700 hover:bg-teal-800`, amber
  accents `bg-amber-50 text-amber-800`, `border-stone-200`, rounded-xl/
  rounded-2xl cards, rounded-full CTAs, `shadow-sm`/`shadow-md` and `min-h-11`
  touch targets.
- Mobile behavior: header/nav remains stacked, H1 starts at `text-3xl`, CTAs
  stack safely, cards stack to one column, no sticky/floating/drawer/menu/gesture
  behavior was added.
- Vietnamese copy now emphasizes family memory and lineage:
  `Lưu giữ ký ức, kết nối các thế hệ.` and
  `Cội nguồn yêu thương của dòng họ...`.
- Added `docs/PLAN_A15A1_PUBLIC_HOME_MODERN_HERITAGE_UI.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-a15a1-public-home-modern-heritage-ui.cjs` and package
  command `check:a15a1-public-home-modern-heritage-ui`.
- Validation PASS: A-15A1, A-15A0, A-14G, A-14F, A-14E, A-14D, A-14C,
  A-14B, A-14A, UI polish, Vietnamese UI copy, Vietnamese cultural UI/UX,
  env safe, migrations, typecheck, lint, root build and diff checks.
- Browser smoke PASS on local `http://localhost:3100/`: desktop and mobile
  viewport checks showed expected Public Home H1/copy/CTA and no horizontal
  overflow. The temporary local server was stopped and the smoke log removed.
- Root `npm run build` passed directly; no clean temp-copy workaround was
  required.
- Decision 178 records that A-15A1 is Public Home only and UI-only.
- Boundary confirmed: no admin/tree/form UI, no DB/schema/migration, no `.sql`,
  no DB apply/check SQL, no API/action/service logic, no auth/permission/route
  change, no runtime merge/dedupe, no permission runtime registration, no
  Worker/OpenNext/Wrangler change, no dependency, no deploy and no push.

## 2026-06-27 - A-15A0 - Gemini Modern Heritage UI/UX Design Spec completed

- Added `docs/PLAN_A15A0_GEMINI_MODERN_HERITAGE_UI_UX_DESIGN_SPEC.md`.
- The doc records the Gemini `Modern Heritage / Di sản Hiện đại` UI/UX design
  output as the accepted source design reference for later A-15A1+ phases.
- A-15A0 is docs-only. It does not implement UI and does not authorize Codex
  to invent design direction outside the spec.
- Future UI work must be split by screen and should only implement ideas when
  compatible state/layout already exists.
- Items requiring later interaction logic review are marked/deferred:
  slide-over selected person panel, bottom navigation, fixed mobile form
  action bar, drawer/bottom sheet animation, pinch zoom gesture, new
  avatar/media behavior, new menu state and new mutation path. Use
  `DEFERRED_REQUIRES_INTERACTION_LOGIC_REVIEW` when new logic is needed.
- Added `scripts/check-a15a0-gemini-modern-heritage-design-spec.cjs` and
  package command `check:a15a0-gemini-modern-heritage-design-spec`.
- Validation PASS: A-15A0 checker, A-14G, A-14F, A-14E, A-14D, A-14C,
  A-14B, A-14A, env safe, migrations, typecheck, lint, root build and diff
  checks.
- Root `npm run build` passed directly; no clean temp-copy workaround was
  required.
- Decision 177 records that the Gemini Modern Heritage spec is UI-only source,
  and A-15A0 does not authorize DB/API/auth/permission/route/runtime/deploy/
  dependency changes.
- Boundary confirmed: no UI component edit, no JSX/class Tailwind runtime
  change, no DB apply, no migration, no `.sql`, no API/action/service logic,
  no auth/permission, no route change, no Worker/OpenNext/Wrangler change, no
  dependency, no deploy and no push.
- `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.

## 2026-06-27 - A-14G-R1 - Public Browser Visual Smoke Retry completed (SAFE_SKIP)

- Reran A-14G-R1 public/read-only visual smoke gate.
- Base URL source: none. `PUBLIC_VISUAL_SMOKE_BASE_URL`,
  `LOCAL_SMOKE_BASE_URL` and `PROD_SMOKE_BASE_URL` were all absent in the
  Codex execution process.
- Result remains `SAFE_SKIP_MISSING_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`; no browser was opened.
- `/` result: `SAFE_SKIP_MISSING_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`.
- `/tree` result: `SAFE_SKIP_MISSING_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`.
- `/people/<slug>` result: `SAFE_SKIP_MISSING_PUBLIC_SAFE_PERSON_SLUG` plus
  `SAFE_SKIP_MISSING_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`; no DB query was run to discover a slug.
- Public not-found/private/error state result:
  `SAFE_SKIP_MISSING_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`.
- Mobile viewport result: `SAFE_SKIP_MOBILE_VIEWPORT_TOOLING_UNAVAILABLE` plus
  `SAFE_SKIP_MISSING_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`.
- No screenshots were captured or committed. No token/cookie/session/storage
  state was read, printed, saved or committed.
- Validation PASS: A-14G, A-14F, A-14E, A-14D, A-14C, A-14B, A-14A, A-14, UI
  polish, Vietnamese UI copy, Vietnamese cultural UI/UX, tree relationship
  picker, inline create, duplicate suggestion, tree polish/dedupe/data-quality,
  A-10/A-11/A-12 merge/dedupe guards, env safe, migrations, typecheck, lint,
  root build and diff checks.
- A-09 authenticated browser smoke returned the expected missing-explicit-auth
  safe-skip.
- `check:merge-dedupe-backup-gate-readiness` is `NOT_AVAILABLE` in this
  checkout; do not infer backup readiness from A-14G-R1.
- Root `npm run build` passed directly; no clean temp-copy workaround was
  required.
- Boundary confirmed: public-only/read-only retry, no admin/auth route smoke,
  no mutation, no DB apply, no check SQL on DB, no migration, no `.sql`, no
  seed/backfill, no runtime merge/dedupe, no permission runtime registration,
  no Worker/OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no dependency, no deploy and no
  push.
- Backup gate remains `BLOCKED_PENDING_OWNER_BACKUP_GATE_CONFIRMATION`.
  DB merge/dedupe remains not applied. Runtime merge/dedupe remains closed.
  Permission runtime remains unregistered.
- `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.
- To get real visual PASS later, owner/operator must provide explicit
  `PUBLIC_VISUAL_SMOKE_BASE_URL` (preferred) or `LOCAL_SMOKE_BASE_URL` /
  `PROD_SMOKE_BASE_URL`; person profile smoke also needs
  `PUBLIC_VISUAL_SMOKE_PERSON_SLUG`.

## 2026-06-27 - A-14G - Public Browser Visual Smoke completed (SAFE_SKIP)

- Added `docs/PLAN_A14G_PUBLIC_BROWSER_VISUAL_SMOKE.md`.
- A-14G ran the public browser visual smoke only in static-readiness form;
  no real visual PASS was claimed because no explicit base URL was set
  in the Codex execution process.
- Base URL resolution followed the A-14F priority
  (`PUBLIC_VISUAL_SMOKE_BASE_URL` then `LOCAL_SMOKE_BASE_URL` then
  `PROD_SMOKE_BASE_URL`); all three were absent, so the result was
  `SAFE_SKIP_MISSING_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`.
- `playwright` MCP server is registered locally but cannot be used to
  navigate to any route without a base URL; the browser-tooling status
  was therefore `SAFE_SKIP_BROWSER_TOOL_UNAVAILABLE` for this run.
- Person profile smoke additionally returned
  `SAFE_SKIP_MISSING_PUBLIC_SAFE_PERSON_SLUG` because no
  `PUBLIC_VISUAL_SMOKE_PERSON_SLUG` env was provided and the phase must
  not query the database to discover a real public-safe slug.
- Mobile viewport smoke returned
  `SAFE_SKIP_MOBILE_VIEWPORT_TOOLING_UNAVAILABLE` because viewport
  resize without a base URL cannot reach any route.
- No screenshots were captured and no auth/session/token/cookie/
  storage-state artifact was produced or committed.
- Targets recorded: public home `/`, public tree `/tree`, public person
  `/people/<slug>`, public error / not-found / private state, mobile
  viewport. All targets stayed at the matching SAFE_SKIP.
- Decision 175 records that A-14G is SAFE_SKIP without explicit base URL
  and that static evidence must not be promoted to a real visual PASS.
- Added `scripts/check-a14g-public-browser-visual-smoke.cjs` and package
  command `check:a14g-public-browser-visual-smoke`.
- Validation PASS: A-14G, A-14F, A-14E, A-14D, A-14C, A-14B, A-14A, A-14,
  UI polish, Vietnamese UI copy, Vietnamese cultural UI/UX, tree
  relationship picker, inline create, duplicate suggestion, tree
  polish/dedupe/data-quality, A-10/A-11/A-12 merge/dedupe guards, env
  safe, migrations, typecheck, lint, root build and diff checks.
- A-09 authenticated browser smoke returned the expected
  missing-explicit-auth safe-skip.
- `check:merge-dedupe-backup-gate-readiness` is `NOT_AVAILABLE` in this
  checkout; do not infer backup readiness from A-14G.
- Root `npm run build` passed directly; no clean temp-copy workaround
  was required.
- Boundary confirmed: no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no check SQL
  on DB, no seed/backfill, no data mutation, no runtime merge/dedupe, no
  route/action/service merge/dedupe, no permission runtime registration,
  no Worker/OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no dependency, no deploy and
  no push.
- Backup gate remains `BLOCKED_PENDING_OWNER_BACKUP_GATE_CONFIRMATION`.
  DB merge/dedupe remains not applied. Runtime merge/dedupe remains
  closed. Permission runtime remains unregistered.
- `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.
- Recommended next phase: A-14H (or a later phase) may attempt a real
  public browser visual smoke only after the owner/operator provides an
  explicit base URL (`PUBLIC_VISUAL_SMOKE_BASE_URL` or
  `LOCAL_SMOKE_BASE_URL` for a local `next dev`/`next start` server, or
  `PROD_SMOKE_BASE_URL` for the deployed production URL) and an
  explicit `PUBLIC_VISUAL_SMOKE_PERSON_SLUG`. Until then, no claim of
  visual PASS is allowed.

## 2026-06-27 - A-14F - Browser Visual Smoke Readiness completed

- Added `docs/PLAN_A14F_BROWSER_VISUAL_SMOKE_READINESS.md`.
- A-14F prepared browser visual smoke readiness for A-14A/B/C/D/E public,
  admin and mobile/tablet surfaces; it did not claim real visual PASS.
- Public read-only candidates: `/`, `/tree`, `/people/[public-safe-slug]` and
  safe public error/private/not-found states when an explicit base URL exists.
- Admin candidates require explicit owner/operator auth session/env:
  `/admin`, `/admin/people`, `/admin/people/new`, `/admin/people/[id]`,
  `/admin/tree`, `/admin/tree/edit` and related-member add panel states.
- Mutation-adjacent paths require separate safe dataset approval and must
  safe-skip without it.
- Browser tooling unavailable is recorded as
  `SAFE_SKIP_BROWSER_TOOL_UNAVAILABLE`, not a fake visual PASS.
- Added `scripts/check-a14f-browser-visual-smoke-readiness.cjs` and package
  command `check:a14f-browser-visual-smoke-readiness`.
- Validation PASS: A-14F, A-14E, A-14D, A-14C, A-14B, A-14A, A-14, UI polish,
  Vietnamese UI copy, Vietnamese cultural UI/UX, tree relationship picker,
  inline create, duplicate suggestion, tree polish/dedupe/data-quality,
  A-10/A-11/A-12 merge/dedupe guards, env safe, migrations, typecheck, lint,
  root build and diff checks.
- A-09 authenticated browser smoke returned the expected missing-explicit-auth
  safe-skip.
- `check:merge-dedupe-backup-gate-readiness` is `NOT_AVAILABLE` in this
  checkout; do not infer backup readiness from A-14F.
- Root `npm run build` passed directly; no clean temp-copy workaround was
  required.

## 2026-06-27 - A-14B - Public Tree / Home UX Classic Modern Polish completed

- Added `docs/PLAN_A14B_PUBLIC_TREE_HOME_UX.md`.
- Public shell now has a warmer family-archive brand treatment, subtitle and
  footer while preserving existing routes.
- Public home now leads with `Lưu giữ ký ức gia đình, kết nối các thế hệ`, clear
  CTAs, privacy-safe public stats and four benefit sections.

## 2026-06-23 - A-14A - Related Member Add UX Overhaul completed

- Added `docs/PLAN_A14A_RELATED_MEMBER_ADD_UX.md`.
- Local branch status before continuing: ahead 0 / behind 0 vs `origin/main`.
  No push was attempted.
- Tree Editor related-member create flow now has two modes:
  - `Thêm nhanh`: full name, gender, birth/death year, short note and duplicate
    suggestion.
  - `Nhập chi tiết hơn`: adds display name, is living, birth/death date, birth
    place, home town, branch, generation, visibility and admin-only private
    note.
- `createPersonAndAttachFromTreeAction()` now passes those existing fields into
  `createPerson()` and still reuses existing relationship actions.
- Unsupported fields were not added: death place, multiple aliases, sibling
  order, sibling action, other-related-person action and inline lineage
  membership assignment need a later schema/service phase if owner approves.
- Classic modern genealogy style direction applied through warm paper/stone
  palette in global CSS, public/admin shells and UI primitives.
- Added `scripts/check-a14a-related-member-add-ux.cjs` and package script
  `check:a14a-related-member-add-ux`.
- Validation PASS: A-14A/A-14, UI/Vietnamese, Tree picker/inline/duplicate/
  data-quality, A-10/A-11/A-12 merge/dedupe, env safe, migrations, typecheck,
  lint, root build and diff checks. A-09 is the expected safe-skip without an
  explicit auth session.
- Boundary confirmed: no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no check SQL run on
  DB, no seed/backfill, no runtime merge/dedupe, no route/action/service
  merge/dedupe, no permission runtime registration, no Worker/OpenNext/Wrangler
  config change, no dependency, no deploy and no push.

## 2026-06-23 - A-14 Bundle - UI/UX Overhaul completed

- Added `docs/PLAN_A14_UI_UX_OVERHAUL.md`.
- Admin layout/navigation now uses grouped sidebar sections for daily work,
  tree surfaces and data safety. Routes were not changed.
- People CRUD polish: filter guidance, mobile card fallback, clearer profile
  actions and form help text/placeholders.
- Relationship CRUD polish: clearer family/parent-child/couple explanations,
  better empty state and warnings when no family unit exists.
- Tree UX polish: toolbar clarifies layout-only dragging, side panel gives
  no-selection guidance, attach-existing warning and distinct pending labels.
- Import/login/revision/system polish: friendlier import issue labels, login
  errors no longer expose raw provider messages, shared PageHeader/EmptyState/
  StatusCallout on secondary admin pages.
- Added `scripts/check-a14-ui-ux-overhaul.cjs` and package script
  `check:a14-ui-ux-overhaul`.
- Updated Tree/A-10/A-11/A-12 checker compatibility allowlists for A-14 UI files
  while keeping SQL/migration/Worker/config/deploy/merge-runtime guardrails.
- Boundary confirmed: no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no check SQL run on
  DB, no seed/backfill, no runtime merge/dedupe, no route/action/service
  merge/dedupe, no permission runtime registration, no Worker/OpenNext/Wrangler
  config change, no dependency, no deploy and no push.

## 2026-06-22 - A-13 Merge/Dedupe DB Apply blocked

- Owner marker `APPROVE_A12_MERGE_DEDUPE_DB_APPLY` was received.
- A-13A static precheck PASS at migration SHA256
  `9645F8E69068C73332A9CCE74E91449E06271734083A1C419176CBBDCA1C75B9`.
- A-13B: `BLOCKED_MISSING_BACKUP_CONFIRMATION` because no fresh snapshot
  timestamp/retention, restore owner/path or exact target confirmation existed.
- PG shell env and `psql` were absent; no repo env file was read.
- A-13C: `SKIPPED_BACKUP_GATE`; DB remains not applied.
- A-13D: `SKIPPED_DB_NOT_APPLIED`; all nine catalog checks remain unexecuted.
- A-13E local static validation PASS for A-10/A-11/A-12, migration/schema, Tree
  dedupe/data-quality, typecheck, lint, build and diff gates. A-09 remained the
  expected safe-skip.
- Static evidence was not promoted to DB verification PASS, and
  `APPROVE_A13_MERGE_DEDUPE_DB_SCHEMA_VERIFIED` is not available.
- Runtime merge/dedupe and permission registration remain closed.
- Resume only after explicit backup/restore/target/tooling confirmation, then
  rerun A-13A before any one-file apply.
- Boundary: no DB/API/network/SQL execution, seed/backfill, data mutation,
  route/action/service, Worker/config/dependency/deploy/push. `PLANNING.MD` was
  not read or committed.

## 2026-06-22 - Owner Review A-12 approved

- Review result: `APPROVED`.
- Review found and corrected two extra `)` tokens after the audit/rollback
  composite FK clauses; A-11 draft parity and checker regression coverage were
  updated.
- Corrected migration SHA256:
  `9645F8E69068C73332A9CCE74E91449E06271734083A1C419176CBBDCA1C75B9`.
- Migration safety, six-table coverage, fail-closed RLS, read-only nine-row check
  SQL and backup/apply/rollback plan are approved for the next owner gate.
- Owner may grant `APPROVE_A12_MERGE_DEDUPE_DB_APPLY` in a separate phase.
  Marker status: `NOT_GRANTED_BY_THIS_REVIEW`; runtime remains closed.
- DB is not applied and check SQL was not run on DB.
- A-10/A-11/A-12, migration/schema and Tree dedupe/data-quality checkers plus
  typecheck, lint, workspace-root production build and diff gates PASS. A-09 is
  the expected missing-explicit-session safe-skip.
- Boundary: no seed/backfill, data mutation, permission runtime,
  route/action/service, Worker/config/dependency/deploy/push. `PLANNING.MD` was
  not read or committed.

## 2026-06-22 - A-12 Bundle - Merge/Dedupe Real Migration Candidate completed

- Owner marker `APPROVE_A11_MERGE_DEDUPE_SCHEMA_CANDIDATE` was received for file
  creation/readiness only.
- Added migration `db/migrations/20260622_0009_merge_dedupe_schema_candidate.sql`
  and read-only check `db/checks/check_merge_dedupe_schema.sql`.
- Migration schema body matches the approved A-11 draft, all six tables enable
  RLS, and no policy/permission/DML/seed/function/trigger/grant exists.
- Migration SHA256 at A-12 bundle commit (superseded by Owner Review correction):
  `5ADECCDAA0396E42CFDED01574B6FCD785617CF01CDCD7F894ECEEF3824A525C`.
- Added A-12 static checker/package command and owner apply plan with exact
  backup, one-file apply, 9-row catalog verification and rollback/no-go gates.
- Decision 165: DB remains not applied; runtime merge/dedupe remains closed.
  Apply requires separate `APPROVE_A12_MERGE_DEDUPE_DB_APPLY` and still does not
  authorize runtime.
- A-10/A-11/A-12, migration/schema and Tree dedupe/data-quality checkers plus
  typecheck, lint, workspace-root production build and diff gates PASS. A-09 is
  the expected missing-explicit-session safe-skip.
- Boundary: no DB/check SQL execution, seed/backfill, data mutation,
  auth/permission runtime, route/action/service, Worker/config/dependency,
  deploy or push. `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.

## 2026-06-22 - Owner Review A-11 approved

- Review result: `APPROVED`.
- Six-table schema coverage, composite audit/rollback correlation, rollback
  restoration and fail-closed RLS boundary are complete.
- Review tightened approved/executed actor/time requirements, non-blank gate
  values, graph evidence, audit reason and no-trigger checker coverage.
- Canonical next marker:
  `APPROVE_A11_MERGE_DEDUPE_SCHEMA_CANDIDATE`.
- Marker status: `NOT_GRANTED_BY_THIS_REVIEW`. It may open a separate real
  migration/check-SQL/apply-plan phase, but does not apply DB or authorize A-12
  runtime merge/dedupe.
- SQL remains `.sql.draft` outside `db/migrations`; DB remains not applied.
- A-10/A-11, migration/schema and Tree dedupe/data-quality checkers plus
  typecheck, lint, workspace-root production build and diff gates PASS. A-09 is
  the expected missing-explicit-session safe-skip.
- Boundary: no seed/backfill, permission runtime, route/action/service,
  Worker/config/dependency/deploy/push. `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.

## 2026-06-22 - A-11 Bundle - Merge/Dedupe Schema Candidate Readiness completed

- Owner marker `APPROVE_A10_MERGE_DEDUPE_RUNTIME_DESIGN` was received for A-11
  candidate work only.
- Added the A-11 design doc, non-applied `.sql.draft`, static checker and package
  command.
- Six candidate tables cover duplicate pairs, sessions, field decisions,
  typed impacts, audit events and rollback manifests.
- Version/conflict/graph state, approval evidence, actor/timestamps, impact
  snapshots and person/relationship/layout/lineage/privacy/revision/export
  rollback coverage are explicit.
- All candidate tables enable RLS with no policies. No `people.merge.*`
  permission is registered; access remains fail-closed if a later real migration
  adopts the candidate.
- Decision 163: DB remains not applied and runtime merge/dedupe remains closed.
  A real migration file requires `APPROVE_A11_MERGE_DEDUPE_SCHEMA`; apply and
  A-12 runtime need later approvals.
- A-10/A-11, migration/schema and related Tree dedupe/data-quality checkers plus
  typecheck, lint, workspace-root production build and diff gates PASS. A-09 is
  the expected missing-explicit-session safe-skip, not a failure.
- Boundary: no real migration, DB apply, seed/backfill, route/action/service,
  data mutation/delete, auth/permission runtime, Worker/config, dependency,
  deploy or push. `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.

## 2026-06-22 - Owner Review A-10 approved

- Review result: `APPROVED`.
- A-10 fully covers advisory strong/medium/weak candidates, same-name create
  continuity, atomic/versioned transaction, conflict and graph validation,
  audit impact, rollback restoration, five proposed permissions, three
  sequential markers and Vietnamese future UI.
- The checker now guards the complete review criteria rather than only section
  presence and a subset of tokens.
- Owner may explicitly use `APPROVE_A10_MERGE_DEDUPE_RUNTIME_DESIGN` to open
  A-11 schema candidate.
- Marker status: `NOT_GRANTED_BY_THIS_REVIEW`; A-11 has not been opened by this
  review and runtime remains closed under Decisions 161 and 162.
- Relevant A-10, Tree, dedupe and data-quality checkers plus typecheck, lint,
  workspace-root production build and diff checks PASS. A-09 remains the honest
  authenticated-browser safe-skip because no explicit session was supplied.
- Boundary: no migration, `.sql`, DB apply, schema/runtime/auth/permission
  change, route/action/service, delete, Worker/config, dependency, deploy or
  push. `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.

## 2026-06-22 - Plan A-10 - Merge/Dedupe Transaction & Audit Design completed

- Added `docs/PLAN_A10_MERGE_DEDUPE_TRANSACTION_AUDIT_DESIGN.md` and its static
  checker/package command.
- Candidate confidence is strong/medium/weak and advisory only. No level
  authorizes automatic merge or blocks a legitimate same-name person.
- Future transaction design is all-or-nothing, version-checked and idempotent by
  `merge_id`; it must validate graph/privacy before and after mutation.
- Audit design covers actors/timestamps/reason/confidence plus field,
  relationship, layout, branch/generation, export and rollback-manifest impact.
- Rollback requires a pre-merge snapshot/manifest and restores source person,
  relationships, layout, membership, visibility and revision trail. Later edits
  require manual conflict reconciliation rather than silent overwrite.
- Proposed permissions and owner markers are design text only. Decision 161
  keeps runtime closed until explicit approval, audit, rollback and schema gates
  are approved.
- Future UI copy is Vietnamese and covers candidate list, person comparison,
  conflict selection, affected relationships, request/approval/execution and
  audit/rollback.
- Required static checker suite, env/migration safety, typecheck, lint and
  workspace-root production build PASS. A-09 remains the honest safe-skip
  `A09_AUTH_BROWSER_SMOKE_SKIPPED_MISSING_EXPLICIT_AUTH_SESSION`.
- Boundary: no migration, `.sql`, DB apply, seed/backfill, schema change,
  runtime merge/dedupe, person/relationship delete, auth/permission runtime
  change, route/action/service, Worker, OpenNext/Wrangler config, dependency,
  deploy or push.
- `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.
- Recommended next phase: owner review of A-10. A-11 schema candidate work may
  begin only after explicit `APPROVE_A10_MERGE_DEDUPE_RUNTIME_DESIGN`; it still
  must not DB apply or open runtime merge.

## 2026-06-22 - Plan A-09 - Authenticated Tree Editor Browser Smoke safe-skipped

- Added `docs/PLAN_A09_AUTHENTICATED_TREE_EDITOR_BROWSER_SMOKE.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-tree-editor-auth-browser-smoke.cjs` and
  `npm run check:tree-editor-auth-browser-smoke`.
- Git sync gate PASS: local `main` and `origin/main` synchronized; worktree was
  clean before A-09 changes.
- Explicit A-09 env/session gates were absent in the Codex process:
  `GIA_PHA_AUTH_BROWSER_SMOKE`, `GIA_PHA_SMOKE_BASE_URL` and
  `GIA_PHA_AUTH_STORAGE_STATE_PATH`.
- Result:
  `A09_AUTH_BROWSER_SMOKE_SKIPPED_MISSING_EXPLICIT_AUTH_SESSION`.
- No authenticated canvas, toolbar, selected-node, add-relative, duplicate
  suggestion or data-quality browser PASS was claimed from static evidence.
- Permission result: `NOT_RUN_MISSING_EXPLICIT_AUTH_SESSION`; no bypass was
  attempted.
- Mutation results:
  - `A09_ATTACH_EXISTING_MUTATION_SKIPPED_MISSING_EXPLICIT_SAFE_DATASET`
  - `A09_CREATE_PERSON_MUTATION_SKIPPED_MISSING_EXPLICIT_SAFE_DATASET`
- Static guards still verify Vietnamese Tree Editor copy, pending/disabled
  submit behavior, no visible UUID entry, duplicate suggestion, read-only
  warning copy and privacy marker exclusions.
- No runtime Tree Editor bug was established or fixed.
- Boundary: no credential read/log, no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no
  seed/backfill, no schema/auth/permission change, no mutation, no
  merge/dedupe, no delete, no Worker/config/dependency/deploy/push.
- `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.
- Recommended next phase: retry A-09 only after owner/operator prepares an
  explicit authorized browser session; mutation smoke additionally needs an
  explicitly approved safe local/staging dataset.

## 2026-06-22 - PLAN_A06_A07_A08_TREE_POLISH_DEDUPE_READINESS_DATA_QUALITY_WARNINGS completed

- Added
  `docs/PLAN_A06_A07_A08_TREE_POLISH_DEDUPE_READINESS_DATA_QUALITY_WARNINGS.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-tree-polish-dedupe-readiness-data-quality.cjs` and
  `npm run check:tree-polish-dedupe-readiness-data-quality`.
- A-06 visual polish:
  - Tree canvas has more space and a stable taller viewport.
  - Selected person card has a visible `Người đang chọn` state.
  - Person cards show clearer year, `Đời thứ` and `Chi nhánh` labels.
  - Family intermediary cards show `Gia đình`, not an English implementation
    label.
  - Toolbar uses `Vừa màn hình`, `Phóng to`, `Thu nhỏ`,
    `Sắp xếp lại cây`, `Lưu bố cục` and `Khôi phục bố cục tự động`.
- Add-relative panel copy is shorter and remains split into selected person,
  relationship, existing/new member and confirmation steps.
- A-07 merge/dedupe readiness is docs/checker-only. No merge UI, action,
  service, route or DB mutation was created.
- No-auto-merge guard:
  - no automatic person merge;
  - no automatic person or relationship deletion;
  - no automatic private/source-note overwrite;
  - no future merge without explicit owner approval, audit and rollback.
- A-08 adds `Gợi ý hoàn thiện dữ liệu` for the selected person using only the
  already loaded graph. Suggestions may cover missing years, missing parents,
  no relationships and clearly similar names.
- Warning UI states:
  `Đây chỉ là gợi ý kiểm tra, hệ thống không tự thay đổi dữ liệu.`
- Decision 160 records that Tree data quality guidance is read-only and future
  merge stays approval-gated.
- Existing auth/permission logic, relationship business rules, route contracts
  and internal UUID/personId behavior remain unchanged.
- Required static checkers, env safety, migration order, typecheck and lint
  PASS.
- Workspace-root build hit the known Windows `.next` ACL `EPERM` before
  compile; clean temporary-copy production build PASS.
- Local browser opened `/admin/tree/edit`, but the current session lacked
  `tree.view`. The route failed closed safely; authenticated canvas visual smoke
  was not claimed. Status:
  `TREE_POLISH_BROWSER_SMOKE_SKIPPED_NO_AUTHORIZED_SESSION`.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no seed/backfill, no schema
  change, no runtime merge/dedupe mutation, no person/relationship delete, no
  Worker, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency, no deploy
  and no push.
- `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.
- Recommended next phase: authenticated browser smoke for the polished Tree
  Editor when explicit owner/operator auth env is available, or a docs-only
  merge transaction/audit design phase without runtime authorization.

## 2026-06-22 - PLAN_A04_A05_TREE_EDITOR_SMOKE_AND_DUPLICATE_SUGGESTION completed

- Added `docs/PLAN_A04_A05_TREE_EDITOR_SMOKE_AND_DUPLICATE_SUGGESTION.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-tree-duplicate-suggestion-ux.cjs` and
  `npm run check:tree-duplicate-suggestion-ux`.
- A-04 authenticated/browser smoke result:
  `A04_AUTH_BROWSER_SMOKE_SKIPPED_MISSING_EXPLICIT_ENV`. No explicit
  browser/auth smoke environment was present in the Codex execution context, so
  no authenticated browser PASS was claimed.
- A-03 source review before A-05 found no blocker: existing-member mode still
  uses relationship actions, new-member mode still uses
  `createPersonAndAttachFromTreeAction`, submit still has a pending/disabled
  guard and UUIDs remain internal form values.
- A-05 duplicate suggestion UX is now available in the Tree Editor quick-create
  form. It uses only the already loaded admin tree graph, normalizes Vietnamese
  names, optionally considers birth/death year proximity and shows at most five
  suggestions.
- Required Vietnamese copy added:
  - `Có thể đã tồn tại thành viên tương tự`
  - `Dùng thành viên này để gắn quan hệ`
  - `Vẫn tạo thành viên mới`
  - `Không tìm thấy thành viên tương tự`
  - `Gợi ý tránh tạo trùng`
  - `Thành viên đã có`
  - `Tạo mới vẫn đúng nếu đây là người khác trong gia đình`
- Choosing an existing suggestion switches to the existing-member attach path
  and submits the matched personId internally. It does not create a new person.
- Choosing to continue creating keeps the existing A-03 quick-create path:
  `createPerson()` first, then attach through existing relationship services.
- Success copy is explicit:
  - Existing member: `Đã gắn quan hệ với thành viên đã có trong cây gia phả.`
  - New member: `Đã thêm thành viên mới và gắn quan hệ vào cây gia phả.`
- Decision 159 records that Tree quick-create duplicate suggestion is
  client-side/advisory, not dedupe schema or merge behavior.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no seed/backfill, no schema
  change, no auth/permission logic change, no Worker created, no
  OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no deploy and no
  push.
- `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.
- Recommended next phase: authenticated browser smoke for Tree Editor
  quick-create only after owner/operator provides explicit browser/auth smoke
  env, or a narrow merge/dedupe planning phase without schema changes.

## 2026-06-22 - Plan A-03 - Tree Inline Create Person UX completed

- Added `docs/PLAN_A03_TREE_INLINE_CREATE_PERSON_UX.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-tree-inline-create-person-ux.cjs` and
  `npm run check:tree-inline-create-person-ux`.
- Existing create-person flow reviewed and reused: `createPerson()` in
  `lib/family/people-service.ts`, existing person validation and existing
  relationship services.
- Added `createPersonAndAttachFromTreeAction` in
  `app/(admin)/admin/tree/edit/actions.ts`. It creates the person first, then
  attaches father, mother, child or spouse/partner through existing services.
- Updated `components/tree/tree-editor-side-panel.tsx` with a compact
  Vietnamese flow:
  - `Chọn quan hệ`
  - `Chọn thành viên đã có`
  - `Tạo thành viên mới`
  - `Lưu và gắn quan hệ`
- Supported relationship types: `Cha`, `Mẹ`, `Con`, `Vợ/chồng/bạn đời`.
- If person creation succeeds but relationship attachment fails, the user sees
  the safe Vietnamese partial-success message beginning with `Đã tạo thành viên
  mới nhưng chưa gắn được quan hệ`.
- Internal UUIDs remain hidden/submitted values; user-facing UI does not ask for
  manual UUID entry.
- Existing auth and permission logic remains unchanged. `people.create` and
  `relationships.create` remain enforced by the existing services.
- Decision 158 records the service-reuse boundary for Tree inline create person.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no seed/backfill, no schema
  change, no auth/permission logic change, no Worker created, no
  OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no deploy and no
  push.
- `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.
- Recommended next phase: browser-level authenticated Tree Editor smoke for
  inline create-person UX, or a narrow polish phase for family linking after
  quick-create.

## 2026-06-21 - UI-UX-VN-02 - Vietnamese Cultural UI/UX Hardening completed

- Added `docs/UI_UX_VN_02_VIETNAMESE_CULTURAL_UI_UX_HARDENING.md`.
- `/admin/relationships` now tells operators to choose members by Vietnamese
  names; visible manual UUID/copy-ID guidance was removed from that surface.
- `RelationshipForm` now accepts a permission-checked `people` list and uses
  member selectors for parent/child relationship creation.
- `CoupleForm` now accepts the same member list and uses selectors for
  spouse/partner relationship creation.
- `/admin/people/[id]` passes the existing member list into the relationship
  forms so person-detail relationship workflows also avoid visible manual ID
  entry.
- Internal submitted values and field names remain unchanged:
  `person_id`, `person1_id`, `person2_id`, `family_id` and
  `related_person_id` stay internal IDs.
- Existing relationship actions, service validation, route structure and
  auth/permission logic remain unchanged.
- Added `scripts/check-vietnamese-cultural-ui-ux.cjs` and
  `npm run check:vietnamese-cultural-ui-ux`.
- Decision 157 records that Vietnamese cultural UI should favor names and
  kinship labels while keeping IDs internal.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no SQL/data mutation, no
  seed/backfill, no schema change, no auth/permission logic change, no Worker
  created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no
  deploy and no push.
- `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.
- Recommended next phase: optional browser-level authenticated Vietnamese
  relationship UX smoke, or a small visual polish phase for dense admin
  relationship screens.

## 2026-06-21 - Plan A-01 - Tree Relationship Picker UX completed

- Replaced the Tree Editor side-panel manual related-person UUID input with a
  Vietnamese searchable member picker.
- Picker source: already loaded admin tree graph, so no new API endpoint was
  added.
- User-visible picker copy includes `Người đang chọn`, `Tìm thành viên`,
  `Tìm theo tên, năm sinh hoặc chi nhánh...`, `Không tìm thấy thành viên phù hợp.`
  and `Kết quả chọn`.
- Picker display label uses member name plus available birth year, generation
  and branch information.
- Internal submitted field remains `related_person_id`; selected value remains
  `person.personId` UUID.
- Existing server actions and relationship service remain unchanged:
  `addParentFromTreeAction`, `addSpouseFromTreeAction` and
  `addChildFromTreeAction`.
- Existing permission/auth logic remains unchanged; relationship creation still
  goes through the current service and `relationships.create` boundary.
- Added `docs/PLAN_A01_TREE_RELATIONSHIP_PICKER_UX.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-tree-relationship-picker-ux.cjs` and
  `npm run check:tree-relationship-picker-ux`.
- Decision 156 records that UUID stays internal while the Tree Editor shows a
  human-friendly member picker.
- Deferred: inline create-new-person from Tree Editor and broader
  `/admin/relationships` UUID form replacement.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no seed/backfill, no schema
  change, no auth/permission logic change, no Worker created, no
  OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no deploy and
  no push.
- `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.
- Recommended next phase: optional browser-level Tree Editor UX smoke with an
  authenticated operator session, or a separate scoped phase to replace UUID
  inputs on `/admin/relationships`.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 132 - Routine Production Monitoring Snapshot completed

- Added `docs/132_ROUTINE_PRODUCTION_MONITORING_SNAPSHOT.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-routine-production-monitoring-snapshot.cjs` and

  `service_role`, `sb_secret_`, `Bearer `, `signedUrl`, `signed_url`,
  `COOKIE` and `SESSION`.
- Current authenticated smoke status remains
  `PHASE_130_BLOCKED_MISSING_EXPLICIT_AUTHENTICATED_SMOKE_ENV`.
- Public monitoring and static validation were not promoted to authenticated
  PASS.
- Decision 155 records that routine public monitoring snapshots are not
  authenticated smoke.
- Boundary: no authenticated smoke run, no credential requested, no secret
  printed or written, no deploy, no push, no migration, no `.sql`, no DB
  apply, no SQL/data mutation, no seed/backfill, no schema change, no
  auth/permission logic change, no export/import runtime expansion, no
  GEDCOM/ZIP/media/backup runtime, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler
  config change and no runtime dependency added.
- `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.
- Recommended next phase: continue routine public production monitoring, or
  retry Phase 130 authenticated production smoke only after owner/operator
  prepares explicit shell-only env in the Codex execution process and
  explicitly approves the retry.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 131 - Production Monitoring and Authenticated Smoke Preparation completed

- Added `docs/131_PRODUCTION_MONITORING_AND_AUTH_SMOKE_PREPARATION.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-production-monitoring-auth-smoke-prep.cjs` and

  and `origin/main` synchronized; worktree clean.
- Production URL:
  `https://web-gia-pha.hungdiepcompany.workers.dev`.

  `notes_private`, `source_note`, token/key/session/signed URL marker found in
  the public route review.
- Current authenticated smoke status remains
  `PHASE_130_BLOCKED_MISSING_EXPLICIT_AUTHENTICATED_SMOKE_ENV`.
- Public monitoring and static validation were not promoted to authenticated
  PASS.
- Future Phase 130 retry requires: synced local/origin, clean worktree,
  reachable production URL, Phase 129 runbook PASS, Phase 130 checker PASS,
  all explicit shell-only env names present, no credential printing/writing
  and explicit owner approval for retry.
- If explicit shell-only env is missing, record
  `SAFE_SKIP_MISSING_EXPLICIT_AUTHENTICATED_SMOKE_ENV` and stop before
  authenticated network requests.
- Decision 154 records that Phase 131 monitoring/prep is docs/checker-only and
  not authenticated smoke.
- Boundary: no authenticated smoke run, no credential requested, no secret
  printed or written, no deploy, no push, no migration, no `.sql`, no DB
  apply, no SQL/data mutation, no seed/backfill, no schema change, no
  auth/permission logic change, no export/import runtime expansion, no
  GEDCOM/ZIP/media/backup runtime, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler
  config change and no runtime dependency added.
- `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.
- Recommended next phase: retry Phase 130 authenticated production smoke only
  after owner/operator prepares explicit shell-only env in the Codex execution
  process and explicitly approves the retry; otherwise continue routine public
  production monitoring.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 130 - Authenticated Production Smoke Result completed

- Owner approved authenticated production smoke only if explicit shell-only
  smoke environment was already present.
- Git sync PASS: local `main` and `origin/main` were synchronized; ahead/behind
  `0 0`; worktree clean before Phase 130 changes.
- Env presence check used names and booleans only; no values were read or

  explicit shell-only smoke variable is missing.
- Boundary: no authenticated request, no deploy, no push, no migration, no
  `.sql`, no DB apply, no SQL mutation, no seed/backfill, no schema change, no
  auth/permission logic change, no export/import runtime expansion, no
  GEDCOM/ZIP/media/backup runtime, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler
  config change and no runtime dependency added.
- `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.
- Recommended next phase: retry Phase 130 only after owner/operator prepares

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 127 - Post Runtime/UI Deploy Readiness Gate completed

- Added `docs/127_POST_RUNTIME_UI_DEPLOY_READINESS_GATE.md` with status
  `READY_FOR_MANUAL_DEPLOY_CHECK`.
- Added `scripts/check-post-runtime-ui-deploy-readiness.cjs` and
  `npm run check:post-runtime-ui-deploy-readiness`.
- Reviewed recent local work for deploy readiness: Phase 125 small JSON export
  hardening, Phase 126 small JSON export smoke/review and UI-VN-01 Vietnamese
  UI copy normalization.
- Runtime/UI changes reviewed: small existing `family.json` export hardening
  and display-only Vietnamese UI/message copy normalization.
- Worker/runtime: Main Worker touched YES by prior small JSON/UI changes;
  runtime dependency added NO; new Worker created NO; OpenNext/Wrangler config
  changed NO; Worker size risk LOW.
- Dependency/config drift: no dependency drift, no Wrangler/OpenNext config
  drift and no deploy workflow mutation in Phase 127.
- Migration/SQL/DB impact: no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no SQL
  mutation, no seed/backfill, no schema change.
- Privacy/security: small JSON export remains guarded and privacy-safe;
  UI-VN-01 did not expose private/source notes, tokens, keys or secrets.
- Deploy readiness status: `READY_FOR_MANUAL_DEPLOY_CHECK`; this is not
  `DEPLOYED` and no deploy/push was performed.
- Validation: post-runtime/UI deploy readiness PASS; Vietnamese UI copy PASS;
  small JSON export smoke PASS; small JSON export hardening PASS; inline admin
  warning UI PASS; export/import final readiness PASS; export/import static
  examples PASS; export/import boundary design PASS; env-safe PASS; migrations
  PASS; typecheck PASS; lint PASS; clean temp `npm run build` PASS.
- Required before any deploy: explicit owner approval for deploy target/timing,
  intended commit, backup/snapshot expectation, GitHub Actions/Cloudflare path,
  Auth/OAuth URL readiness, rollback owner/path and post-deploy smoke operator.
- Root workspace build remains expected to hit the known Windows `.next` ACL
  `EPERM` before compile; use clean temp build excluding `.git`, `.next`,
  `node_modules`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` to distinguish source build
  failures from local artifact locks.
- Boundary: no deploy, no push, no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no SQL
  mutation, no seed/backfill, no schema change, no permission/auth logic
  change, no export/import runtime expansion, no GEDCOM/ZIP/media/backup
  runtime, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change and no runtime
  dependency added.
- `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.
- Recommended next phase: owner-approved manual deploy check/deploy phase, or
  defer deploy and continue with separately approved product/runtime work.

## 2026-06-19 - UI-VN-01 - Vietnamese UI Copy Normalization completed

- Normalized user-visible UI copy to Vietnamese with diacritics across admin
  navigation/dashboard, people, relationships, tree viewer/editor,
  import/export preview, public pages, revisions, system status, backup
  dry-run and related service/validation messages.
- Textfield labels/placeholders and combobox/dropdown display labels were
  normalized where user-visible.
- Code/internal values remained unchanged: route paths, identifiers,
  component/function names, DB table/column names, enum values, permission keys,
  API fields, JSON keys, package/env names and migration/SQL contracts were not
  renamed.
- Added `docs/UI_VN_01_VIETNAMESE_UI_COPY_NORMALIZATION.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-vietnamese-ui-copy.cjs` and
  `npm run check:vietnamese-ui-copy`.
- Decision 149 records that UI-VN-01 is display-only copy normalization and
  does not authorize schema, migration, DB apply, runtime expansion, Worker,
  dependency, deploy or push work.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no SQL mutation, no
  seed/backfill, no schema change, no permission/auth logic change, no
  export/import runtime expansion, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler
  config change, no runtime dependency added, no deploy and no push.
- `PLANNING.MD` was not read or committed.
- Recommended next path: a small browser-level Vietnamese copy smoke if owner
  wants screenshots, otherwise continue only with the next separately approved
  product/runtime phase.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 126 - Small JSON Export Smoke Review completed

- Reviewed Phase 125 small `family.json` export hardening with local
  static/source smoke only; no DB query, real export file generation, deploy or
  production data access.
- Added `docs/126_SMALL_JSON_EXPORT_SMOKE_REVIEW.md` with metadata, privacy,
  lineage and runtime-boundary review results.
- Added `scripts/check-small-json-export-smoke.cjs` and
  `npm run check:small-json-export-smoke`.
- Smoke confirmed source coverage for `schema_version`, `app_export_version`,
  `exported_at`, `export_scope`, `privacy_scope`, lineage sections and lineage
  counts.
- Privacy review confirmed future non-admin builder paths use the existing
  privacy sanitizer, filter hidden rows, strip private/source notes, clear
  audit/delete actors and omit non-admin tree layout coordinates.
- Lineage review confirmed runtime export source references only `clans`,
  `clan_branches`, `generation_rules` and `person_branch_memberships`; no
  unsupported future media/name/life-event/burial/persistent-warning tables.
- Decision 148 records that Phase 126 is static smoke/review only and does not
  authorize export expansion, DB access, Worker, dependency, config, deploy or
  push work.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker touched NO in Phase 126 review; runtime
  dependency added NO; new service Worker created NO; OpenNext/Wrangler config
  changed NO; Worker size risk NO.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no SQL mutation, no
  seed/backfill, no large JSON export runtime, no GEDCOM runtime, no ZIP
  runtime, no import parser runtime, no media export/import, no backup/restore
  runtime, no deploy and no push.
- Validation: small JSON export smoke PASS; small JSON export hardening PASS;
  export/import final readiness PASS; export/import static examples PASS;
  export/import boundary design PASS; inline admin warning UI PASS; Vietnamese
  genealogy manual SQL diagnostic, domain UI and domain readiness PASS;
  env-safe PASS; migrations PASS; typecheck PASS; lint PASS; clean temp
  `npm run build` PASS; Git whitespace checks PASS.
- Workspace-root build remains blocked before compile by the pre-existing
  Windows `.next` ACL `EPERM` unlink error. The clean temp copy build passed
  with `.git`, `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` were not read;
  `PLANNING.MD` was not committed.
- Recommended next path: defer further export implementation, or request a
  separately owner-approved export-service boundary design phase before large
  JSON/GEDCOM/ZIP/media/backup expansion.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 125 - Small Main-App JSON Export Hardening completed

- Owner approved Phase 125 small main-app JSON export hardening only.
- Reviewed existing JSON export surface:
  `app/(admin)/admin/exports/download/json/route.ts`,
  `lib/family/json-exporter.ts`, `lib/family/export-collector.ts` and
  `lib/family/export-types.ts`.
- Hardened `family.json` metadata with `app_export_version`, `export_scope`
  and `privacy_scope`; existing `schema_version`, `exported_at`, app metadata,
  manifest and checksum behavior remain.
- Added lineage export sections for existing verified tables only: `clans`,
  `clan_branches`, `generation_rules` and `person_branch_memberships`.
- Hardened non-admin JSON builder behavior for future `family`/`public` calls:
  people are sanitized through the existing privacy service, hidden rows are
  filtered, private/source notes are stripped, audit/delete actor fields are
  cleared and non-admin tree layout coordinates are omitted.
- Added `docs/125_SMALL_JSON_EXPORT_HARDENING.md`,
  `scripts/check-small-json-export-hardening.cjs` and
  `npm run check:small-json-export-hardening`.
- Decision 147 records that Phase 125 is only small JSON export hardening and
  does not authorize large JSON, GEDCOM/ZIP/media, backup/restore, import
  parser, Worker, dependency, config, deploy, migration or DB mutation work.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker touched YES, limited to existing small JSON
  export code; runtime dependency added NO; new service Worker created NO;
  OpenNext/Wrangler config changed NO; Worker size risk LOW.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no SQL mutation, no
  seed/backfill, no large JSON export runtime, no GEDCOM heavy runtime, no ZIP
  runtime, no import parser runtime, no media export/import, no backup/restore
  runtime, no deploy and no push.
- Validation: small JSON export hardening PASS; export/import final readiness
  PASS; export/import static examples PASS; export/import boundary design PASS;
  inline admin warning UI PASS; Vietnamese genealogy manual SQL diagnostic,
  domain UI and domain readiness PASS; env-safe PASS; migrations PASS;
  typecheck PASS; lint PASS; clean temp `npm run build` PASS; Git whitespace
  checks PASS.
- Workspace-root build remains blocked before compile by the pre-existing
  Windows `.next` ACL `EPERM` unlink error. The clean temp copy build passed
  with `.git`, `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` were not read;
  `PLANNING.MD` was not committed.
- Recommended next path: Phase 126 small JSON export smoke/review, or defer
  further export implementation until a separately owner-approved
  export-service boundary design phase.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 122C-124C Export/Import Final Readiness Matrix completed

- Added `docs/122C_EXPORT_COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md` with export compatibility
  status for `family.json`, GEDCOM, ZIP, media-later, core genealogy tables,
  lineage tables, tree layouts, revisions, future media/warnings,
  public/family/admin export scopes and living-person privacy handling.
- Added `docs/123C_IMPORT_COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md` with import compatibility
  status for current/older/future `family.json`, GEDCOM, ZIP, media-later,
  validation matrix, conflict handling, preview expectations and
  restore/import apply gates.
- Added `docs/124C_PORTABILITY_BACKUP_FINAL_READINESS_GATE.md` with final
  docs/contracts/examples readiness, runtime not-ready list, decision matrix,
  required owner approvals, no-go runtime conditions, privacy/security notes
  and default recommendation.
- Added `scripts/check-export-import-final-readiness.cjs` and
  `npm run check:export-import-final-readiness`.
- Decision 146 records that the bundle is an owner decision gate only, not
  runtime, schema, service Worker, dependency, config, deploy or mutation
  approval.
- Default recommendation: defer implementation, or only consider separately
  approved small main-app JSON export hardening if it adds no heavy runtime,
  dependency or Worker changes.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker touched NO; runtime dependency added NO; new
  service Worker created NO; OpenNext/Wrangler config changed NO; large
  export/import/media/GEDCOM/ZIP/backup/restore work NO.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no SQL mutation, no
  seed/backfill, no large JSON/GEDCOM/ZIP runtime, no import parser runtime, no
  media export/import, no backup/restore runtime, no deploy and no push.
- Validation: export/import final readiness PASS; export/import static
  examples PASS; export/import boundary design PASS; inline admin warning UI
  PASS; media-quality final readiness, static examples, static contracts and
  boundary design PASS; Vietnamese genealogy manual SQL diagnostic, domain UI
  and domain readiness PASS; env-safe PASS; migrations PASS; typecheck PASS;

  Windows `.next` ACL `EPERM` unlink error. The clean temp copy build passed
  with `.git`, `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` were not read;
  `PLANNING.MD` was not committed.
- Recommended next path: defer implementation or request a separately
  owner-approved Phase 125 small JSON export hardening design/runtime gate.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 122B-124B Export/Import Static Examples And Test Contracts completed

- Added `docs/122B_EXPORT_STATIC_EXAMPLES_ACCEPTANCE_CHECKLIST.md` with static
  `family.json` export shape, public/family/admin privacy-safe cases, GEDCOM

  `PLANNING.MD` was not committed.
- Recommended next path: Phase 122C/123C/124C static compatibility matrix or a
  separately owner-approved service-boundary design phase.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 122A-124A Export/Import Boundary And Portability Contract completed

- Added `docs/122A_EXPORT_BOUNDARY_DESIGN.md` for design-only export boundary:
  current foundation, `family.json`, GEDCOM, ZIP, media-later, data groups,
  privacy rules, main Worker limits and export-service/ZIP/GEDCOM approval
  gates.

  `PLANNING.MD` was not committed.
- Recommended next path: Phase 122B/123B/124B static examples/checklists, or a
  separately owner-approved service-boundary design phase.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 121B Inline Warning UI Post-Integration Smoke completed

- Completed post-integration smoke/review after commit `86d4ad6`.
- Admin smoke: `/admin/genealogy` with no effective permissions failed closed,
  showing the existing permission message and no fake warning data.
- Public smoke: `/tree` showed no admin warning panel/copy and no console
  warning/error.
- UI/copy review passed: labels remain `Thông tin`, `Cảnh báo`, `Cần xử lý`;
  warning cards include an actionable next step and safe empty-state copy.
- Privacy review passed: warning copy does not expose `notes_private`,
  `source_note`, hidden relationship facts, credentials, media/storage details
  or raw source material.
- Hardened `scripts/check-inline-admin-warning-ui.cjs` to scan public
  route/component source for admin warning imports/helpers and persistent
  warning references.
- Added `docs/121B_INLINE_WARNING_UI_POST_INTEGRATION_SMOKE.md`.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker touched only by checker/doc hardening in this
  phase; runtime dependency added NO; new service Worker created NO;
  OpenNext/Wrangler config changed NO; heavy scan/media/export/import work NO.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no SQL mutation, no
  seed/backfill, no persistent warning table, no full-tree scan, no media work,
  no deploy and no push.
- Validation: inline admin warning UI PASS; media-quality final readiness,
  static examples, static contracts and boundary design PASS; Vietnamese
  genealogy manual SQL diagnostic, domain UI and domain readiness PASS;
  env-safe PASS; migrations PASS; typecheck PASS; lint PASS; clean temp
  `npm run build` PASS; Git whitespace checks PASS.
- Workspace-root build remains blocked before compile by the pre-existing
  Windows `.next` ACL `EPERM` unlink error. The clean temp copy build passed
  with `.git`, `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` were not read;
  `PLANNING.MD` was not committed.
- Recommended next path: keep media, persistent warnings and heavy scans
  deferred; require separate owner approval for any schema, service Worker,
  media, export/import or broader runtime phase.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 121A Lightweight Inline Admin Warning UI completed

- Owner-approved Option D was implemented only as deterministic inline admin
  hints from data already loaded on person, genealogy, membership and selected
  tree-node surfaces.
- Added reusable Vietnamese warning badge/list UI and pure warning-rule
  helpers; no warning query, persistence, background job or full-tree scan was
  introduced.
- Admin people warnings cover incomplete identity, invalid date order,
  living-person public visibility, multiple primary memberships, incomplete
  lineage assignment and lineage scope conflicts.
- Admin genealogy warnings summarize the already-loaded memberships; the tree
  editor only evaluates the selected loaded person node.
- Warning UI remains inside existing admin permission boundaries, does not
  expose private notes/source notes and is not present on public routes.
- Added `docs/121A_INLINE_ADMIN_WARNING_UI.md`,
  `scripts/check-inline-admin-warning-ui.cjs` and
  `npm run check:inline-admin-warning-ui`.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker receives only the small existing-app component
  and helper code; runtime dependency added NO; new service Worker created NO;
  OpenNext/Wrangler config changed NO; heavy scan/media/export/import work NO.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no SQL mutation, no
  seed/backfill, no persistent warning table, no full-tree scan, no media work,
  no deploy and no push.
- Validation: inline admin warning UI PASS; media-quality final readiness,
  static examples, static contracts and boundary design PASS; Vietnamese
  genealogy manual SQL diagnostic, domain UI and domain readiness PASS;
  env-safe PASS; migrations PASS; typecheck PASS; lint PASS; clean temp
  `npm run build` PASS; Git whitespace checks PASS.
- Workspace-root build remains blocked before compile by the pre-existing
  Windows `.next` ACL `EPERM` unlink error. The clean temp copy build passed
  with `.git`, `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` were not read;
  `PLANNING.MD` was not committed.
- Recommended next path: keep media, persistent warnings and heavy scans
  deferred; require separate owner approval for any Phase 121B schema, service
  or broader runtime scope.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 118D-120D Vietnamese Genealogy Media/Data Quality Final Readiness completed

- Completed final docs-only readiness/signoff review after commit `3bc3847`.
- Created `docs/118D_120D_MEDIA_QUALITY_FINAL_READINESS_REVIEW.md` with Phase 118D media review, Phase 119D data-quality review, Phase 120D admin warning UX review, decision matrix, owner approvals and no-go conditions.
- Decision matrix result: option A defer all implementation is `RECOMMENDED_DEFAULT`.
- Option D inline admin warning UI is `CONDITIONALLY_READY` only through a separate explicit owner-approved lightweight runtime phase with no schema, persistence, heavy scan, Worker, dependency or config change.
- Options B/C are ready only for separately approved docs/static schema-candidate phases; options E/F are ready only for separately approved service design phases, not Worker implementation.
- Added `scripts/check-media-quality-final-readiness.cjs` and `npm run check:media-quality-final-readiness`.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker touched NO; runtime dependency added NO; new service Worker created NO; OpenNext/Wrangler config changed NO; Worker size risk introduced NO.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql` file, no DB apply, no SQL mutation, no seed/backfill, no media upload/storage bucket, no thumbnail/image processing, no persistent warning table, no full-tree runtime scan, no runtime warning UI, no large export/import/GEDCOM/ZIP, no deploy and no push.
- Validation: final readiness checker PASS, static examples/contracts/boundary checkers PASS, Phase 103-120D Vietnamese genealogy static checkers PASS, env-safe PASS, migrations PASS, typecheck PASS, lint PASS, clean temp `npm run build` PASS, `git diff --check` PASS and `git diff --cached --check` PASS.
- Note for next AI: workspace-root `npm run build` remains blocked before compile by pre-existing Windows `.next` artifact ACL error `EPERM: operation not permitted, unlink 'D:\CODE\GIA PHẢ\.next\build\56416d4ae4ce586f.js'`; clean temp copy build passed with `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- Note for next AI: this final readiness review is a decision gate, not approval for any option B-F. Require explicit owner approval naming the selected path.
- `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` were not read; `PLANNING.MD` was not committed.
- Recommended next path: keep option A, or request explicit owner approval for a narrowly scoped option D phase.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 118C-120C Vietnamese Genealogy Media/Data Quality Acceptance Examples completed

- Grouped Phase 118C, 119C and 120C completed locally as docs/static examples and acceptance checklists after commit `7f794d7`.

- Phase 120C result: created `docs/120C_ADMIN_WARNING_UX_ACCEPTANCE_CHECKLIST.md` with acceptance criteria for people, genealogy, tree editor, future import/export warning surfaces, copy, accessibility and privacy.
- Added `scripts/check-media-quality-static-examples.cjs` and `npm run check:media-quality-static-examples`.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker touched NO; runtime dependency added NO; new service Worker created NO; OpenNext/Wrangler config changed NO; Worker size risk introduced NO.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql` file, no DB apply, no SQL mutation, no seed/backfill, no media upload/storage bucket, no thumbnail/image processing, no persistent warning table, no full-tree runtime scan, no runtime warning UI, no large export/import/GEDCOM/ZIP, no deploy and no push.
- Validation: media/data-quality static examples checker PASS, static contracts checker PASS, boundary design checker PASS, Phase 103-120C Vietnamese genealogy static checkers PASS, env-safe PASS, migrations PASS, typecheck PASS, lint PASS, clean temp `npm run build` PASS, `git diff --check` PASS and `git diff --cached --check` PASS.
- Note for next AI: workspace-root `npm run build` remains blocked before compile by pre-existing Windows `.next` artifact ACL error `EPERM: operation not permitted, unlink 'D:\CODE\GIA PHẢ\.next\build\56416d4ae4ce586f.js'`; clean temp copy build passed with `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- Note for next AI: static examples are acceptance evidence only. They are not fixtures, runtime data, schema authorization or service/Worker approval.
- `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` were not read; `PLANNING.MD` was not committed.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 118D/119D/120D review-only refinement, or a separately owner-approved schema/service/runtime candidate phase.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 118B-120B Vietnamese Genealogy Media/Data Quality Static Contracts completed

- Grouped Phase 118B, 119B and 120B completed locally as docs/static contract and approval-gate work after commit `a436cfa`.
- Phase 118B result: created `docs/118B_MEDIA_STATIC_CONTRACT_AND_APPROVAL_GATE.md` for future media metadata concepts, storage contract fields, privacy contract, media-service boundary and approval gates before media migration or media-service Worker.
- Phase 119B result: created `docs/119B_DATA_QUALITY_STATIC_CONTRACT_AND_APPROVAL_GATE.md` for warning categories, severity contract, future warning shape, privacy boundary and approval gates before persistent warning migration or quality-service Worker.
- Phase 120B result: created `docs/120B_ADMIN_WARNING_UX_STATIC_CONTRACT.md` for admin warning locations, Vietnamese labels, UX states, privacy-safe copy, accessibility/basic UI rules and schema/service boundaries.
- Added `scripts/check-media-quality-static-contracts.cjs` and `npm run check:media-quality-static-contracts`.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker touched NO; runtime dependency added NO; new service Worker created NO; OpenNext/Wrangler config changed NO; Worker size risk introduced NO.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql` file, no DB apply, no SQL mutation, no seed/backfill, no media upload/storage bucket, no thumbnail/image/video/file processing, no persistent warning table, no full-tree runtime scan, no large export/import/GEDCOM/ZIP, no deploy and no push.

- Note for next AI: workspace-root `npm run build` remains blocked before compile by pre-existing Windows `.next` artifact ACL error `EPERM: operation not permitted, unlink 'D:\CODE\GIA PHẢ\.next\build\56416d4ae4ce586f.js'`; clean temp copy build passed with `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- Note for next AI: these contracts are approval gates, not implementation permission. Any future media migration, storage provider activation, media-service Worker, persistent warning table, full-tree quality scan, import preview scan or export-readiness scan needs separate owner-approved phase.
- `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` were not read; `PLANNING.MD` was not committed.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 118C/119C/120C static examples and acceptance checklists, or a separately owner-approved schema/service candidate phase.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 118A-120A Vietnamese Genealogy Media/Data Quality Boundary Design completed

- Grouped Phase 118A, 119A and 120A completed locally as design-only boundary planning after Phase 117A commit `4a3f45038950f18d6e9bdf680d4c66de171b5e3e`.
- Phase 118A result: created `docs/118A_MEDIA_DOMAIN_STORAGE_BOUNDARY_DESIGN.md` for media domain/storage boundary, portraits, grave/tombstone photos, family documents/photos, branch/clan documents, event photos, metadata concepts, privacy and future storage/service gates.
- Phase 119A result: created `docs/119A_DATA_QUALITY_BOUNDARY_WARNING_DESIGN.md` for data-quality warning categories, severity, admin display locations, privacy and service-boundary split.
- Phase 120A result: created `docs/120A_ADMIN_WARNING_UX_PLANNING.md` for admin warning UX principles, Vietnamese severity labels, empty states, privacy-safe behavior and deferred runtime work.
- Added `scripts/check-media-quality-boundary-design.cjs` and `npm run check:media-quality-boundary-design`.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker touched NO; runtime dependency added NO; new service Worker created NO; OpenNext/Wrangler config changed NO; Worker size risk introduced NO.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql` file, no DB apply, no SQL mutation, no seed/backfill, no media upload/storage bucket, no real image/video/file processing, no thumbnail generation, no large export/import/GEDCOM/ZIP, no deploy and no push.
- Validation: media/data-quality boundary checker PASS, Phase 103-120A Vietnamese genealogy static checkers PASS, env-safe PASS, migrations PASS, typecheck PASS, lint PASS, clean temp `npm run build` PASS, `git diff --check` PASS and `git diff --cached --check` PASS.
- Note for next AI: workspace-root `npm run build` remains blocked before compile by pre-existing Windows `.next` artifact ACL error `EPERM: operation not permitted, unlink 'D:\CODE\GIA PHẢ\.next\build\56416d4ae4ce586f.js'`; clean temp copy build passed with `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- Note for next AI: `docs/RUNTIME_WORKER_GUARDRAIL.md` and `docs/SERVICE_BOUNDARY_ROADMAP.md` remain mandatory before any future media upload/storage, large data-quality scan, import preview, GEDCOM/ZIP, new Worker, dependency or deploy/config work.
- `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` were not read; `PLANNING.MD` was not committed.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 118B/119B/120B static contract/checklist work, or owner-approved Phase 121 only if it explicitly stays within boundary gates.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 117A Vietnamese Genealogy Admin UX Polish completed

- Phase 117A completed locally as a scoped polish pass after grouped Phase 114-117 commit `22aff0f28e3f361a13e79cca831dd7935eb7ac45`.
- UX polish: admin genealogy dashboard/routes now use clearer Vietnamese labels and saved messages; empty states include next-step links.
- Form polish: clan, branch, generation rule and membership forms now have clearer Vietnamese labels, placeholders and helper text.
- Validation polish: required-field validation returns Vietnamese messages; duplicate/unique and foreign-key action errors are mapped to clearer user-facing copy.
- Double-submit guard: genealogy submit buttons use `useFormStatus` pending labels without adding dependencies.
- Person membership UX: person detail lineage section now explains explicit lineage-table assignment and warns when a clan prerequisite is missing.
- Tree display: admin tree cards label lineage display as `Dòng họ` and `Chi`, preferring lineage branch metadata when present.
- Public privacy remains conservative: public routes still do not query lineage tables, sanitizer still clears lineage fields unless public-visible and not living, and source/private/family-only membership data is not exposed publicly.
- Created `docs/117A_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_ADMIN_UX_POLISH.md` and updated `docs/00_INDEX.md`.
- Updated `scripts/check-vietnamese-genealogy-domain-ui.cjs` to cover Phase 117A doc/polish markers and public privacy guard continuity.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker touched YES for lightweight admin UI polish only; runtime dependency added NO; new service Worker created NO; OpenNext/Wrangler config changed NO; Worker size risk LOW.
- Validation: Phase 103-117A Vietnamese genealogy static checkers PASS, env-safe PASS, migrations PASS, typecheck PASS, lint PASS, clean temp `npm run build` PASS, `git diff --check` PASS and `git diff --cached --check` PASS.
- Note for next AI: workspace-root `npm run build` remains blocked before compile by pre-existing Windows `.next` artifact ACL error `EPERM: operation not permitted, unlink 'D:\CODE\GIA PHẢ\.next\build\56416d4ae4ce586f.js'`; clean temp copy build passed with `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- Boundary: no migration, no DB apply, no SQL mutation, no seed/backfill, no excluded runtime tables, no media/upload/storage, no large export/import/GEDCOM/ZIP, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no deploy, no push and `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` not read.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 118A Media Domain and Storage Boundary Design.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 114-117 Vietnamese Genealogy Domain UI Integration completed

- Grouped Phase 114-117 completed locally after Phase 113C `PASS_MANUAL_SQL_DIAGNOSTIC`.
- Phase 114 result: added server-only lineage types, validation and service layer for `clans`, `clan_branches`, `generation_rules` and `person_branch_memberships`.
- Phase 115 result: added admin routes `/admin/genealogy`, `/admin/genealogy/clans`, `/admin/genealogy/branches`, `/admin/genealogy/generation-rules` and `/admin/genealogy/memberships`.
- Phase 116 result: person detail pages now show branch membership and include an explicit assignment form when the user has an existing manage permission.
- Phase 117 result: admin tree can display lineage membership data; public sanitizer clears lineage fields unless future lineage data is public-visible and the person is not living. Public routes do not query lineage tables in this phase.
- Permissions used: read via `people.view` or `tree.view`; manage via `people.update`, `relationships.update`, `tree.edit_layout` or `settings.manage`.
- Created `docs/114_117_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_DOMAIN_UI_INTEGRATION.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-vietnamese-genealogy-domain-ui.cjs` and `npm run check:vietnamese-genealogy-domain-ui`.
- Updated `docs/00_INDEX.md`, `docs/08_AI_WORK_LOG.md` and `docs/09_DECISION_LOG.md`.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker touched YES for lightweight admin CRUD/UI only; runtime dependency added NO; new service Worker created NO; OpenNext/Wrangler config changed NO; Worker size risk LOW.
- Validation: Phase 103-117 Vietnamese genealogy static checkers PASS, env-safe PASS, migrations PASS, typecheck PASS, lint PASS, clean temp `npm run build` PASS, `git diff --check` PASS and `git diff --cached --check` PASS.
- Note for next AI: workspace-root `npm run build` is blocked before compile by pre-existing Windows `.next` artifact ACL error `EPERM: operation not permitted, unlink 'D:\CODE\GIA PHẢ\.next\build\56416d4ae4ce586f.js'`; clean temp copy build passed with `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- Deferred: export/import/GEDCOM/ZIP/media/data-quality work remains boundary-governed and not implemented here.
- Boundary: no migration created, no DB apply, no SQL mutation by Codex, no seed/backfill, no automatic backfill from `people.branch_name` or `people.generation_number`, no excluded tables used, no media/upload/storage, no large export/import/GEDCOM/ZIP, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no deploy, no push and `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` not read.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 118A Media Domain and Storage Boundary Design, or a focused Phase 117A UX polish pass for genealogy admin selectors.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 113C Vietnamese Genealogy Manual SQL Diagnostic PASS recorded

- Phase 113C recorded owner/operator-provided manual read-only SQL diagnostic PASS from Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor.
- Target Supabase project ref: `frkyeuxrlcflmsxxsolp`.
- Migration file: `db/migrations/20260618_0008_vietnamese_genealogy_first_migration.sql`.
- Final DB verification status: `PASS_MANUAL_SQL_DIAGNOSTIC`.
- Credential verifier status: `REST_VERIFIER_NOT_USED_FOR_PASS`.
- Required tables result: PASS for `clans`, `clan_branches`, `generation_rules` and `person_branch_memberships`.
- Excluded tables result: PASS; `person_names`, `person_life_events`, `person_burials` and `person_media` do not exist per owner/operator diagnostic.
- Existing core tables result: PASS for `people`, `families`, `family_parents`, `family_children` and `couple_relationships`.
- RLS result: PASS; owner/operator diagnostic confirmed RLS enabled on all four new lineage tables.
- Policies result: PASS; owner/operator diagnostic confirmed policies exist for all four new lineage tables.
- No seed/backfill result: PASS; owner/operator diagnostic confirmed zero rows in all four new lineage tables.
- Created `docs/113C_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_MANUAL_SQL_DIAGNOSTIC_PASS.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-vietnamese-genealogy-manual-sql-diagnostic-pass.cjs` and `npm run check:vietnamese-genealogy-manual-sql-diagnostic-pass`.
- Security note remains active: service role key material was previously exposed in chat and must be rotated or revoked before future credential-assisted verification. Do not repeat, request, write or commit credential values.
- Boundary: no DB apply by Codex, no migration rerun, no SQL execution by Codex, no SQL mutation, no seed/backfill, no migration file change, no new migration, no runtime app code change, no UI change, no deploy, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no push and `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` not read.
- Recommended next phase: grouped Phase 114-117 can start.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 113B-fix Vietnamese Genealogy Verification Diagnostic completed

- Phase 113B-fix handled owner-provided PowerShell verifier output that returned `FAIL`, not PASS.
- Current DB verification status: `NOT_VERIFIED`; do not record PASS from the current evidence.
- Required REST table checks failed for `clans`, `clan_branches`, `generation_rules` and `person_branch_memberships`.
- RLS result: not verified by REST-only verifier; needs SQL metadata evidence.
- Policy result: not verified by REST-only verifier; needs `pg_policies` evidence.
- Excluded scope result: not fully proven by current evidence; needs sanitized SQL output showing `person_names`, `person_life_events`, `person_burials` and `person_media` are absent.
- No seed/backfill result: not proven; needs read-only row-count SQL output for the four lineage tables.
- Existing table safety result: not proven; needs sanitized SQL output showing `people`, `families`, `family_parents`, `family_children` and `couple_relationships` still exist.
- Added `docs/113B_FIX_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_VERIFICATION_DIAGNOSTIC.md` with diagnostic hypotheses and manual Supabase Dashboard read-only SQL checks.
- Hardened `scripts/verify-vietnamese-genealogy-migration-post-apply.cjs` to classify table failures, verify expected project ref shape, check existing core table REST readability and avoid claiming RLS/policy PASS from REST-only evidence.
- Added `scripts/check-vietnamese-genealogy-verification-diagnostic.cjs` and `npm run check:vietnamese-genealogy-verification-diagnostic`.
- Security note: service role key material was exposed in chat by the owner/operator. The exposed key must be rotated or revoked before further credential-assisted verification. Do not repeat, request, write or commit credential values.
- Boundary: no DB apply, no migration rerun, no SQL mutation, no seed/backfill, no migration file modification, no new migration, no runtime app code change, no UI change, no deploy, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no push and `PLANNING.MD` not read or committed.
- No-go before Phase 114-117: required tables, RLS, policies, excluded scope, no seed/backfill and existing core table safety must be proven by sanitized SQL evidence, or the owner must explicitly accept proceeding with the limitation recorded.
- Recommended next step: owner rotates/revokes the exposed key, then runs the manual SQL checklist in Supabase Dashboard for project `frkyeuxrlcflmsxxsolp` and provides sanitized results.

## 2026-06-18 - Phase 113B Vietnamese Genealogy Credential Verification recorded

- Phase 113B attempted credential-assisted read-only post-apply verification.
- Explicit verification env was missing: `VIET_GENEALOGY_VERIFY_SUPABASE_URL`, `VIET_GENEALOGY_VERIFY_SUPABASE_SERVER_KEY` and `VIET_GENEALOGY_VERIFY_MODE=read_only`.
- Verifier result: `SKIPPED_MISSING_EXPLICIT_VERIFICATION_CREDENTIALS`.
- Final verification status: `PASS_WITH_SAFE_SKIP`.
- Created `docs/113B_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_CREDENTIAL_VERIFICATION.md`.

- Required tables result: not independently DB-verified due missing env.
- RLS result: not independently DB-verified due missing env.
- Policy result: not independently DB-verified due missing env.
- Excluded scope result: not independently DB-verified due missing env.
- No seed/backfill result: not independently DB-verified due missing env.
- Existing table safety result: not independently DB-verified due missing env.
- Static source review remains unchanged: migration creates only `clans`, `clan_branches`, `generation_rules` and `person_branch_memberships`, enables RLS, uses existing permissions and includes no seed/backfill.
- Boundary: no DB apply, no migration rerun, no SQL mutation, no seed/backfill, no migration file modification, no new migration, no deploy, no runtime app code change, no UI change, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no push and `PLANNING.MD` not read or committed.

- Expected SHA256: `522B11AF4D8BDA4F1E29AB63C49C9718129ADF1B27F3F2119BB40D9F7214EA5F`.
- Actual SHA256: `522B11AF4D8BDA4F1E29AB63C49C9718129ADF1B27F3F2119BB40D9F7214EA5F`.
- Created `docs/113A_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_MANUAL_APPLY_VERIFICATION.md`.
- Added `scripts/verify-vietnamese-genealogy-migration-post-apply.cjs` and `npm run verify:vietnamese-genealogy-migration:post-apply`.

- Recommended next phase: Phase 113B Credential-Assisted Vietnamese Genealogy Read-Only DB Verification before Phase 114-117. If the owner accepts owner-confirmation-only evidence, Phase 114-117 grouped prompt can start with this limitation recorded.

## 2026-06-18 - Phase 113 Vietnamese Genealogy Migration Apply Execution recorded

- Owner approval received for DB apply of `db/migrations/20260618_0008_vietnamese_genealogy_first_migration.sql`.
- Target Supabase project ref: `frkyeuxrlcflmsxxsolp`.
- DB backup/snapshot: `DONE`.
- Expected SHA256: `522B11AF4D8BDA4F1E29AB63C49C9718129ADF1B27F3F2119BB40D9F7214EA5F`.

- Pre-apply local/static checks passed.
- Local Supabase project ref file matched `frkyeuxrlcflmsxxsolp`, but Supabase CLI was not available in PATH and `.env.local` was missing.
- Apply result: `OWNER_ACTION_REQUIRED`; Codex did not run local DB apply.
- Required owner/operator action: manually apply exactly the approved migration file through a controlled Supabase Dashboard or equivalent one-file-only path, then record the result.
- DB verification result: `NOT_RUN_APPLY_NOT_CONFIRMED`; read-only post-apply verification still needs to confirm tables, RLS, policies, no old table drift, no excluded tables, no seed rows and no backfill.
- Created `docs/113_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_MIGRATION_APPLY_EXECUTION.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-vietnamese-genealogy-migration-apply-execution.cjs` and `npm run check:vietnamese-genealogy-migration-apply-execution`.
- Boundary: no migration file modification, no extra migration, no extra SQL executed, no seed data, no production data mutation, no backfill from `people.branch_name`, no backfill from `people.generation_number`, no deploy, no runtime app code change, no UI change, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no push and `PLANNING.MD` not read or committed.
- Validation: genealogy domain/schema/scope/real-migration/readiness/apply-execution checkers PASS, env-safe PASS, migrations PASS, typecheck PASS, lint PASS, `git diff --check` PASS and `git diff --cached --check` PASS.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 113A Owner Manual Apply Result Capture And Read-Only Verification. Phase 114-117 should wait until apply confirmation and read-only verification are recorded.

## 2026-06-18 - Phase 112 Vietnamese Genealogy Migration Apply Readiness completed

- Created `docs/112_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_MIGRATION_APPLY_READINESS.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-vietnamese-genealogy-migration-apply-readiness.cjs` and `npm run check:vietnamese-genealogy-migration-apply-readiness`.
- Reviewed migration file `db/migrations/20260618_0008_vietnamese_genealogy_first_migration.sql` without modifying it.
- Migration fingerprint recorded: SHA256 `522B11AF4D8BDA4F1E29AB63C49C9718129ADF1B27F3F2119BB40D9F7214EA5F`.
- Readiness result: `READY_FOR_PHASE_113_APPROVAL_REQUEST`.
- Apply status remains `NOT_APPLIED`.
- Required before Phase 113: explicit owner approval for DB apply, correct Supabase project ref, current DB backup/snapshot, migration path confirmation, checksum comparison, RLS review, rollback owner/path and post-apply verification plan.
- No-go: wrong/unconfirmed project, missing backup, unclear rollback, failing migration/readiness checker, out-of-scope migration contents, unclear RLS/privacy or missing Phase 113 owner approval.
- Post-apply verification plan: verify tables, RLS, policies, unchanged old tables, build/runtime surfaces and no Worker/runtime changes.
- Worker/runtime: no main Worker touch, no runtime dependency, no service Worker, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change and no Worker size risk.
- Boundary: no DB apply, no SQL executed, no Supabase command run, no production data mutation, no migration file modified, no new migration created, no deploy, no runtime app code change, no UI change, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no push and `PLANNING.MD` not read or committed.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 113 only if owner explicitly approves DB apply.

## 2026-06-18 - Phase 111 Vietnamese Genealogy Real Migration File completed

- Owner approved Phase 111 real migration file creation only.
- Created migration file `db/migrations/20260618_0008_vietnamese_genealogy_first_migration.sql`.
- Created `docs/111_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_REAL_MIGRATION_FILE.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-vietnamese-genealogy-real-migration-file.cjs` and `npm run check:vietnamese-genealogy-real-migration-file`.
- Approved tables included: `clans`, `clan_branches`, `generation_rules`, `person_branch_memberships`.
- Explicitly excluded: `person_names`, `person_life_events`, `person_burials`, `person_media`, media processing, large export/import/GEDCOM/ZIP work, runtime app changes, Worker/service creation, DB apply, seed data and automatic backfill from `people.branch_name` or `people.generation_number`.
- RLS/privacy: all four new tables have RLS enabled from creation. Policies use existing permissions only: read via `people.view` or `tree.view`; insert/update via `people.update`, `relationships.update`, `tree.edit_layout` or `settings.manage`. No public-wide direct table access was added.
- Export/import follow-up: future `family.json` support must preserve clan, branch, generation rule and membership rows with stable IDs and reference validation; GEDCOM remains partial/JSON-first.
- Worker/runtime: no main Worker touch, no runtime dependency, no service Worker, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change and no Worker size risk.
- Apply status: `NOT_APPLIED`.
- Boundary: no DB apply, no SQL executed, no production data mutation, no deploy, no runtime app code change, no UI change, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no push and `PLANNING.MD` not read or committed.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 112 Domain Migration Apply Readiness.

## 2026-06-18 - Phase 110B Vietnamese Genealogy First Migration Scope completed

- Created `docs/110B_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_FIRST_MIGRATION_SCOPE.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-vietnamese-genealogy-first-migration-scope.cjs` and `npm run check:vietnamese-genealogy-first-migration-scope`.
- Current status: `PHASE_111_NOT_APPROVED`.
- Required marker: `OWNER_APPROVAL_REQUIRED_BEFORE_PHASE_111_REAL_MIGRATION_FILE=true`.
- Final proposed first migration scope if owner approves later: `clans`, `clan_branches`, `generation_rules`, `person_branch_memberships`.
- Optional owner decision: include or defer `person_names`.
- Deferred from first migration: `person_life_events`, `person_burials`, `person_media`, media processing, large export/import/GEDCOM/ZIP work, runtime app changes, Worker/service creation, DB apply and automatic backfill from `people.branch_name`.
- Privacy/RLS: all allowed first-migration tables must have RLS enabled; public output must remain filtered through server-side privacy rules.
- Export/import: allowed tables must eventually be preserved in `family.json`; GEDCOM remains partial and JSON-first for clan/branch/generation metadata.
- Worker/runtime: no main Worker touch, no runtime dependency, no service Worker, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change and no Worker size risk.
- Boundary: no real migration file, no DB apply, no SQL executed, no deploy, no runtime app change, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no push and `PLANNING.MD` not read or committed.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 111 only if owner explicitly approves real migration file creation and answers the open scope questions.

## 2026-06-18 - Phase 108-110 Schema Candidate Owner Review completed

- Created `docs/108_110_SCHEMA_CANDIDATE_OWNER_REVIEW.md`.
- Review result: Phase 108-110 candidate is directionally sound but should not proceed directly to Phase 111 without scope and policy decisions.
- Recommended owner decision: `REQUEST_CHANGES_BEFORE_PHASE_111`.
- Proposed first migration scope if owner approves later: `clans`, `clan_branches`, `generation_rules`, `person_branch_memberships`; `person_names` is optional only if owner confirms immediate need.
- Deferred from first migration: `person_life_events`, `person_burials`, `person_media`, media processing, large export/import/GEDCOM/ZIP work and runtime changes.
- Boundary: no real migration file, no DB apply, no SQL executed, no deploy, no runtime app change, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no package added, no push and `PLANNING.MD` not committed.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 111 only if owner approves real migration file creation after review changes/questions are resolved.

## 2026-06-18 - Phase 108-110 Vietnamese Genealogy Schema Candidate Gate completed

- Created `docs/108_110_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_SCHEMA_CANDIDATE.md` for schema strategy, candidate tables/fields, compatibility, worker boundary notes and real migration approval gate.
- Added `scripts/check-vietnamese-genealogy-schema-candidate.cjs` and `npm run check:vietnamese-genealogy-schema-candidate`.
- Candidate recommendation: normalize `clans`, `clan_branches`, `generation_rules`, `person_branch_memberships` and `person_names` first; defer `person_life_events` and `person_burials` to recommended next; keep `person_media` later until Phase 118A media/storage boundary design.
- Phase 110 remains approval-only: no real migration file, no DB apply and no SQL execution.
- Boundary: no deploy, no runtime app change, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no push and `PLANNING.MD` not committed.
- Recommended next phase: review schema candidate; start Phase 111 only if owner approves real migration file creation.

## 2026-06-18 - Phase 103-107 Vietnamese Genealogy Domain Guardrail Hardening completed

- Phase 103-107 docs were hardened so `Required Now` cannot be mistaken for authorization to create schema, migration, DB apply, runtime, UI, service Worker or production changes.
- Phase 104 priority wording now uses `Specification Required Now`, with a nearby note clarifying it means specification/readiness only.
- Added cross-references to `docs/RUNTIME_WORKER_GUARDRAIL.md` and `docs/SERVICE_BOUNDARY_ROADMAP.md` for large export/import/media/GEDCOM/ZIP processing.
- Added runtime and Worker boundary status checklist to the Phase 103-107 bundle.
- Boundary: no migration, no DB apply, no deploy, no runtime app change, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no package added, no push.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 108-110 Vietnamese Genealogy Schema Candidate Design / Static Safety Check / Approval Gate.

## 2026-06-18 - Runtime Worker Guardrail and Service Boundary Roadmap docs prepared

- Created `docs/RUNTIME_WORKER_GUARDRAIL.md` to keep the main Cloudflare/OpenNext Worker small and prevent heavy runtime/dependency drift.
- Created `docs/SERVICE_BOUNDARY_ROADMAP.md` to map main app, backup service, export service, import service, media service and data-quality service candidates.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` reading rules so AI only reads these guardrail docs when the task touches runtime/export/import/media/backup/dependency/Worker concerns.
- Updated `docs/00_INDEX.md` with the two new docs.
- Updated `docs/02_ARCHITECTURE.md` with a short cross-reference and main Worker responsibility boundary.
- Updated `docs/07_PHASE_PLAN.md` with Phase 102B plus A/B boundary checkpoints for media/export/import/data-quality phases.
- Boundary: docs only, no migration, no DB apply, no deploy, no runtime code change, no Worker created, no package added, no push.
- Recommended next phase: apply these docs into the repo, then continue Phase 108-110 schema candidate design / static safety / approval gate.

## 2026-06-18 - Phase 103-107 Vietnamese Genealogy Domain Model Readiness completed

- Bundle 1 completed as docs/checker only.
- Created `docs/103_107_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_DOMAIN_MODEL_READINESS.md`.
- Added `npm run check:vietnamese-genealogy-domain`.
- Phase 103 documented Vietnamese genealogy domain concepts: `dong_ho`, `chi`, `nhanh`, `doi`, `the_he`, founder, clan head, branch head, spouse/child/adopted/step relationships, memorial and privacy needs.
- Phase 104 recorded current model strengths and gaps, classified as Required Now / Recommended Next / Later.
- Phase 105 specified Vietnamese person profile fields and public/private defaults.
- Phase 106 specified relationship rules, child ordering and conflict warnings.
- Phase 107 specified clan/branch/generation structure, tree filtering and export/import compatibility.
- Boundary: no migration, no DB apply, no deploy, no production data mutation, no runtime app change.
- Validation: env safe, migration order, domain checker, typecheck, lint and `git diff --check` PASS.
- Direct build hit known Windows `.next` EPERM artifact lock; isolated temp build PASS and temp artifacts/config rewrites were removed.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 108-110 schema candidate design, candidate static safety and explicit approval gate before any real migration.

Phase 15D đã chạy gate đầy đủ và thử deploy thật bằng `npm.cmd run deploy`, nhưng deploy bị BLOCKED bởi known OpenNext/Windows local blocker trước khi upload/deploy lên Cloudflare. Không có production URL mới, không có Cloudflare deployment mới và chưa smoke test production.

### Gate đã PASS

- Repo sạch trước deploy.
- Branch: `main`.
- Local commit: `b04657535a94378df0a6811a15fff247131d5cac`.
- `origin/main`: `b04657535a94378df0a6811a15fff247131d5cac`.
- GitHub Actions OpenNext Cloudflare Build Gate: PASS.
- Run URL: https://github.com/hungdiepcompany-del/giapha/actions/runs/27631937702
- Local checks/build: PASS.
- Audit: PASS_WITH_KNOWN_AUDIT_ADVISORIES.

### User confirmations before deploy

- Backup `family.json`: DONE, outside repo.
- Backup `full-backup.zip`: DONE, outside repo.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: configured as Text.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: configured as Text.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: configured as Text.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: configured as Secret.

### Deploy attempt

- Command: `npm.cmd run deploy`.
- Next build: PASS.
- OpenNext bundle on Windows: FAIL.
- Error summary: `ENOENT` copying `.open-next/.build/open-next.config.edge.mjs` to `.open-next/middleware/open-next.config.mjs`.
- Cloudflare upload/deploy reached: No.

### Boundary giữ nguyên

- Không sửa schema.
- Không tạo/chạy migration.
- Không sửa dữ liệu thật.
- Không làm import confirm thật.
- Không làm revision restore thật.
- Không in secret.
- Không commit `.env.local` hoặc `.dev.vars`.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Use WSL/Linux for deploy, or create a dedicated GitHub Actions deploy workflow only after explicit user confirmation. If deploy later PASS, continue Phase 16 - Production Stabilization.

## 2026-06-16 - Phase 15C Linux/GitHub Actions OpenNext Build Gate completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có GitHub Actions/Linux build gate cho OpenNext Cloudflare build. Phase này chỉ thêm workflow/checker/docs, chưa deploy thật, chưa upload, chưa push remote, không tạo Cloudflare deployment, không chạy migration, không sửa schema và không đổi business logic.

### Workflow mới

- `.github/workflows/opennext-build-gate.yml`
- Trigger: `workflow_dispatch`, `pull_request` vào `main`, `push` vào `main`
- Runner: `ubuntu-latest`
- Node: `24`
- Cài dependency bằng `npm ci`
- Chạy check scripts, typecheck, lint, `npm run build` và `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build`
- Không chạy `npm run deploy`, `npm run upload` hoặc `wrangler deploy`

### Script/docs mới

- `scripts/check-github-actions-opennext-gate.cjs`
- `npm run check:github-actions-opennext`
- `docs/15C_GITHUB_ACTIONS_OPENNEXT_BUILD_GATE.md`

### Env/secrets policy

- Workflow là build gate, không phải deploy.
- Workflow có placeholder env để build khi chưa cấu hình production secrets thật.
- Không dùng workflow này để smoke test Supabase thật.
- Production deploy phase sau mới cấu hình Cloudflare/GitHub secrets/env thật.

### Audit status

- `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` vẫn có advisory trong Next/OpenNext/Wrangler/PostCSS/esbuild/ws chain.
- Không chạy `npm audit fix --force`.
- Nếu checks/build PASS, Phase 15C được xem là READY_TO_RUN_ON_GITHUB với known audit advisories.

### Local validation

- Gate Phase 15B signs: PASS.
- `npm run check:github-actions-opennext`: PASS.
- `npm run check:opennext-cloudflare`: PASS.
- `npm run check:service-boundary`: PASS.
- `npm run typecheck`: PASS.
- `npm run lint`: PASS.
- `npm run build`: PASS.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`: PASS_WITH_KNOWN_AUDIT_ADVISORIES.
- Phase 15C status: READY_TO_RUN_ON_GITHUB.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Push commit lên GitHub để chạy OpenNext Cloudflare Build Gate. Nếu GitHub Actions PASS, tiếp tục Phase 15D - First Cloudflare Deploy Retry.

## 2026-06-16 - Phase 15B Service Boundary & Worker Split Readiness completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có service boundary readiness để tránh main Worker phình to về sau. Phase này chỉ tạo docs, template worker và checker; chưa tách Worker thật, chưa tạo Cloudflare service thật, chưa deploy, chưa upload, chưa push remote, không chạy migration và không đổi business logic.

### Boundary đã ghi nhận

- Main Web Worker giữ UI public/admin, auth callback, people CRUD nhẹ, relationship CRUD nhẹ, tree viewer/editor nhẹ và gọi service phụ khi cần.
- `export-backup-worker` tương lai xử lý `family.json`, GEDCOM, ZIP backup, checksum và scheduled/manual backup.
- `import-validate-worker` tương lai xử lý JSON parse, schema validation, missing reference validation, cycle check và conflict report; phase đầu không ghi DB.
- `media-worker` tương lai xử lý upload ảnh, resize/compress, metadata và media backup.
- `pdf-image-export-worker` tương lai xử lý xuất ảnh cây và PDF.

### File/script mới

- `docs/15_SERVICE_BOUNDARY_WORKER_SPLIT.md`
- `services/_template-worker/`
- `scripts/check-service-boundary-readiness.cjs`
- `npm run check:service-boundary`

### OpenNext/Windows note

- OpenNext wiring check PASS bằng `npm run check:opennext-cloudflare`.
- Next build PASS bằng `npm run build`.
- `npx.cmd opennextjs-cloudflare build` trên Windows thuần có thể bị BLOCKED bởi compatibility issue của OpenNext.
- Build/deploy thật nên chạy bằng WSL/Linux/GitHub Actions hoặc môi trường Cloudflare-compatible.

### Check status

- All project readiness/type/lint/build checks PASS.
- `npm.cmd audit --audit-level=moderate` FAIL vì advisory còn trong `next`/`postcss`, `@opennextjs/cloudflare`/`wrangler`/`esbuild`/`ws`.
- Không chạy `npm audit fix --force` vì ngoài scope, có advisory no-fix và force path có thể gây breaking downgrade.
- Phase 15B technical status: PASS.
- Commit status: allowed with audit exception.
- Audit status: npm audit still reports advisories in dependency/toolchain chain.
- Policy: no `npm audit fix --force`; track upstream package updates.
- Reason: current advisory remediation may require force/breaking changes and could destabilize Next/OpenNext deploy wiring.
- Kết luận validation: PASS_WITH_KNOWN_AUDIT_ADVISORIES.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 15C - GitHub Actions/WSL OpenNext Build Gate hoặc retry first Cloudflare deploy bằng môi trường Linux sau khi backup và production env/secrets đã sẵn sàng.

## 2026-06-16 - Phase 15A OpenNext Cloudflare Workers Wiring completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có wiring deploy rõ ràng cho Cloudflare Workers qua OpenNext. Phase này chỉ cài/cấu hình deploy adapter và docs/checker, chưa deploy thật, chưa upload, chưa push remote, không chạy migration, không sửa schema/auth/business logic và không đọc/in `.env.local`.

### File/script mới hoặc cập nhật

- `@opennextjs/cloudflare`
- `wrangler`
- `open-next.config.ts`
- `wrangler.toml`
- `eslint.config.mjs` ignores generated `.open-next` output
- `scripts/check-opennext-cloudflare-wiring.cjs`
- `docs/14_OPENNEXT_CLOUDFLARE_WIRING.md`
- `npm run check:opennext-cloudflare`
- `npm run preview`
- `npm run deploy`
- `npm run upload`
- `npm run cf-typegen`

### Deploy boundary

- Target: Cloudflare Workers via OpenNext.
- `npm run deploy`, `npm run upload` và `npx wrangler deploy` vẫn chưa được chạy.
- Trước khi retry Phase 15, cần backup `family.json` và `full-backup.zip`.
- Cần cấu hình Cloudflare variables/secrets: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` phải là secret/server-side, không dùng `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Chạy lại Phase 15 - First Cloudflare Deploy.

## 2026-06-16 - Phase 14 Deploy Readiness completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có deploy readiness baseline cho first Cloudflare deploy. Phase này chỉ tạo docs/check/script, không deploy thật, không push remote, không tạo Cloudflare project, không sửa schema/auth/business logic và không đọc/in `.env.local`.

### File/script mới

- `docs/13_DEPLOY_READINESS.md`
- `scripts/check-deploy-readiness.cjs`
- `npm run check:deploy-readiness`

### Deploy readiness policy

- Target deploy: Cloudflare, nhưng Pages versus Workers wiring cần xác nhận ở Phase 15.
- Production env bắt buộc: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`.
- `.env.example` chỉ giữ placeholder rỗng.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` chỉ server-side, không dùng `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
- Trước deploy cần cập nhật Supabase Site URL/Redirect URLs và Google OAuth Authorized JavaScript origin.
- Trước deploy có rủi ro dữ liệu cần tải `family.json` và `full-backup.zip`.

### Boundary giữ nguyên

- Không chạy lại migrations 0001-0006.
- Không tạo migration mới.
- Không bật import confirm thật.
- Không bật revision restore thật.
- Không deploy hoặc push remote.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 15 - First Cloudflare Deploy.

## 2026-06-16 - Phase 13 UI Polish Foundation completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có UI polish foundation trên các bề mặt chính. Phase này chỉ sửa giao diện/copy/layout và thêm checker, không sửa schema, RLS, auth callback, business logic dữ liệu, import confirm hoặc revision restore.

### UI primitives mới

- `components/ui/page-header.tsx`
- `components/ui/section-card.tsx`
- `components/ui/status-callout.tsx`
- `components/ui/empty-state.tsx`
- `components/ui/action-link.tsx`

### UI đã polish

- Admin shell: nav rõ hơn, active route rõ hơn, user/role/permission context gọn hơn.
- Public homepage/tree/profile: hero, CTA, readonly/public privacy copy.
- Login page: Google OAuth và magic link phân biệt rõ hơn.
- People list/form: bảng dễ đọc hơn, form chia nhóm thông tin.
- Relationships: giải thích family, cha mẹ/con, quan hệ đôi và UUID.
- Tree viewer/editor: toolbar rõ hơn, hướng dẫn click/kéo/lưu layout, empty state rõ hơn.
- Export/import: nhấn mạnh `family.json` là backup chính, import preview chưa ghi DB.

### Script check mới

- `npm run check:ui-polish`

### Boundary giữ nguyên

- Không tạo migration.
- Không chạy lại migrations 0001-0006.
- Không sửa auth callback/PKCE.
- Không bật import confirm thật.
- Không bật revision restore thật.
- Không deploy hoặc push remote.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 14 - Deploy Readiness hoặc Phase 14 - Import Confirm Planning, tùy ưu tiên.

## 2026-06-16 - Phase 12 Real Supabase Smoke Test Baseline completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có mốc baseline ổn định sau real Supabase smoke test. Phase 12 chỉ cập nhật tài liệu và report, không sửa code app, không tạo migration, không deploy và không push remote.

### File/report mới

- `docs/12_REAL_SUPABASE_SMOKE_TEST_REPORT.md`

### User-confirmed smoke status

- Google OAuth login: PASS.
- User đã thêm người thật vào database thật: PASS.
- Main routes/functions smoke test chính: OK theo xác nhận của user.
- PKCE issue trước đó: tự hết, xem như transient browser/cookie/origin issue nếu không tái diễn.

### Baseline policy

- Đây là baseline ổn định trước UI polish.
- Không chạy lại toàn bộ migration 0001-0006 sau khi đã có dữ liệu thật nếu chưa review schema/data state.
- Không bật import confirm thật nếu chưa có transaction, final validation, conflict resolution và log an toàn.
- Không bật revision restore thật nếu chưa có transaction, validation và revision mới cho hành động restore.

### Chưa làm

- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa làm import confirm thật.
- Chưa làm revision restore thật.
- Chưa ghi nhận per-route evidence độc lập từ Codex trong Phase 12; report dùng `PASS_USER_CONFIRMED` hoặc `NOT_CONFIRMED` đúng mức xác nhận.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 13 - UI Polish Foundation. Không ưu tiên import confirm thật ở bước kế tiếp.

## 2026-06-16 - Google OAuth login added

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có thêm đăng nhập Google OAuth qua Supabase Auth để tránh phụ thuộc hoàn toàn vào magic link khi gặp `email rate limit exceeded` hoặc `otp_expired`.

### File/route đã cập nhật

- `components/auth/login-form.tsx`
- `app/auth/login/page.tsx`
- `app/auth/callback/route.ts`
- `docs/10_SUPABASE_SETUP.md`

### Auth behavior

- `/auth/login` vẫn giữ form magic link.
- `/auth/login` có thêm nút `Đăng nhập với Google`, gọi Supabase `signInWithOAuth` với `redirectTo` là `${window.location.origin}/auth/callback`.
- `/auth/callback` xử lý cả magic link và Google OAuth bằng `exchangeCodeForSession(code)`.
- `/auth/callback` ưu tiên `error_code`/`error` trước khi kiểm tra thiếu `code`.
- Exchange lỗi redirect về `/auth/login?reason=auth_callback_failed` và chỉ log metadata an toàn: name, message, status/code.
- Callback thành công vẫn ưu tiên `/admin` khi user có `people.view`.

### Cấu hình thủ công còn cần user kiểm tra

- Google Cloud OAuth Client có Authorized redirect URI: `https://<SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`.
- Supabase Dashboard -> Authentication -> Providers -> Google đã Enabled và có Client ID/Secret.
- Supabase URL Configuration local có:
  - `http://localhost:3000/**`
  - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
- Khi deploy Cloudflare Pages, thêm redirect URL tương ứng cho `https://<pages-project>.pages.dev/**` và `/auth/callback`.

### Chưa làm

- Chưa tạo migration.
- Chưa sửa schema/role/OWNER.
- Chưa commit secret.
- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

User kiểm tra cấu hình Google Cloud/Supabase Dashboard rồi smoke test `/auth/login` bằng Google OAuth với tài khoản OWNER thật.

## 2026-06-16 - Phase 11 Supabase Integration & Real Smoke Test Gate completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có gate chuẩn bị tích hợp Supabase thật. Phase này không chạy migration thật, không deploy, không push và không commit secret.

### File/route/script đã có

- `docs/10_SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
- `docs/11_SMOKE_TEST_CHECKLIST.md`
- `scripts/check-env-safe.cjs`
- `scripts/check-migrations-order.cjs`
- `/admin/system/status`
- `npm run check:env:safe`
- `npm run check:migrations`

### Supabase integration behavior

- `.env.local` vẫn chỉ là file local, không commit.
- `check:env:safe` chỉ in trạng thái present/missing, không in giá trị secret.
- `check:migrations` kiểm migration folder, thứ tự tên file, đủ prefix `0001` đến `0006`, không duplicate prefix và không conflict marker.
- `/admin/system/status` yêu cầu `settings.manage` hoặc `permissions.manage`, chỉ hiển thị trạng thái env dạng yes/no và danh sách foundation checks.

### Chưa làm

- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa chạy migration thật trên Supabase.
- Chưa test login Supabase thật.
- Chưa gán OWNER thật.
- Chưa smoke test CRUD/export/import preview bằng user thật.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

User cấu hình `.env.local`, chạy migrations thật, đăng nhập lần đầu, gán OWNER bằng `db/snippets/assign-owner-role.sql`, rồi chạy checklist `docs/11_SMOKE_TEST_CHECKLIST.md`.

## 2026-06-15 - Phase 10 Import JSON Foundation completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có Import JSON foundation dạng preview an toàn. Admin có route `/admin/exports/import` để upload hoặc paste `family.json`, kiểm tra schema, quan hệ, vòng tổ tiên và conflict cơ bản với DB hiện tại.

### Import service/UI đã có

- `lib/family/import-types.ts`
- `lib/family/json-import-validator.ts`
- `lib/family/json-import-preview-service.ts`
- `app/(admin)/admin/exports/import/page.tsx`
- `app/(admin)/admin/exports/import/actions.ts`
- `components/imports/json-import-preview-form.tsx`

### Import behavior

- Hỗ trợ preview schema `1.0.0`.
- Validate JSON parse được, `schema_version`, `people`, `full_name`, duplicate person/family IDs, reference giữa family/person/layout và vòng tổ tiên.
- Conflict check DB nếu có Supabase/admin config và user có `imports.create`: existing person IDs, duplicate slugs, family IDs, tree layout IDs.
- Nếu thiếu Supabase config, route vẫn cho kiểm tra cấu trúc file và báo conflict DB unavailable an toàn.
- File/input giới hạn 5MB.
- Nút xác nhận import bị disabled; Phase 10 không ghi DB, không lưu file, không restore dữ liệu.

### Permission/privacy status

- Route import yêu cầu `imports.create` khi Supabase/auth đã cấu hình.
- Service role chỉ dùng server-side trong conflict check.
- Client form chỉ gọi server action, không nhận secret.
- Không tạo mock data, không ghi đè dữ liệu hiện tại.

### Script check đã tạo

- `npm run check:import-json`

### Chưa làm

- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa làm import thật.
- Chưa ghi import job/revision log cho thao tác import.
- Chưa có transaction import/rollback.
- Chưa kiểm thử với Supabase data thật.

### Lưu ý cho AI tiếp theo

- Không bật import thật nếu chưa có transaction, validation final, conflict resolution và revision/import log.
- Không overwrite person/family/layout theo ID cũ nếu chưa có chế độ xác nhận rõ ràng.
- `family.json` vẫn là bản bảo toàn dữ liệu chính; GEDCOM không thay thế được JSON.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 11 - Import transaction/restore planning hoặc UI polish foundation.

## 2026-06-15 - Phase 9 Revision History UI Foundation completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có Revision History UI foundation. Admin có thể xem danh sách revision, lọc cơ bản và mở chi tiết để xem before/after JSON cùng diff field.

### Revision service/UI đã có

- `lib/family/revision-types.ts`
- `lib/family/revision-service.ts`
- `lib/family/revision-diff.ts`
- `/admin/revisions`
- `/admin/revisions/[id]`

### Revision behavior

- `/admin/revisions` hiển thị thời gian, action, entity_type, entity_id, changed_by và reason.
- Filter hỗ trợ `entity_type`, `action`, `entity_id`, `changed_by`, `changed_from`, `changed_to`.
- `/admin/revisions/[id]` hiển thị metadata, diff field, `revision_items` nếu có và raw before/after JSON.
- `/admin/people/[id]` có link nhanh tới `/admin/revisions?entity_type=people&entity_id=<id>` nếu user có `revisions.view`.

### Restore status

- Phase 9 chưa làm restore thật.
- Nút restore là placeholder disabled.
- Người có `revisions.restore` chỉ thấy ghi chú rằng restore thật cần transaction, validation và revision mới.

### Permission/privacy status

- Service và route kiểm `revisions.view` server-side.
- Revision có thể chứa dữ liệu nhạy cảm trong `before_json`/`after_json`, không public.
- Không đưa service role key ra client.

### Script check đã tạo

- `npm run check:revisions`

### Lệnh đã chạy

- Baseline trước khi sửa: `npm run check:foundation`, `npm run check:auth-permissions`, `npm run check:people`, `npm run check:relationships`, `npm run check:tree-viewer`, `npm run check:tree-editor`, `npm run check:public-privacy`, `npm run check:export-backup`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Phase 9: `npm run check:revisions`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check` - PASS
- Browser route check `/admin/revisions`, `/admin/revisions/fake-id` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3000` - PASS; routes render nội dung an toàn, không crash trắng.
- `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` - WARN, còn 2 moderate warnings từ `next`/`postcss`; không chạy force fix vì breaking change ngoài scope.

### Chưa làm

- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa làm restore thật.
- Chưa có transaction/validation restore.
- Chưa kiểm thử với dữ liệu Supabase thật.
- NPM audit còn 2 moderate warnings từ `next`/`postcss`.

### Lưu ý cho AI tiếp theo

- Không bật restore thật nếu chưa có validation, transaction và revision log cho hành động restore.
- Revision detail có thể hiển thị dữ liệu nhạy cảm nên không đưa ra public route.
- Nếu mở restore, phải xử lý từng `entity_type` riêng, không dùng generic overwrite mù.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 10 - Import JSON foundation hoặc UI polish foundation.

## 2026-06-15 - Phase 8 Export/backup foundation completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có export/backup foundation. Admin có route `/admin/exports` để tải `family.json`, `family.ged` và `full-backup.zip`.

### Export/backup service đã có

- `lib/family/export-types.ts`
- `lib/family/export-collector.ts`
- `lib/family/json-exporter.ts`
- `lib/family/gedcom-exporter.ts`
- `lib/family/checksum.ts`
- `lib/family/zip-backup-exporter.ts`

### Route đã có

- `/admin/exports`: trang admin backup/export.
- `/admin/exports/download/json`: tải `family.json`.
- `/admin/exports/download/gedcom`: tải `family.ged`.
- `/admin/exports/download/zip`: tải `full-backup.zip`.

### Database migration đã có

- `db/migrations/20260614_0006_export_backup_foundation.sql`
- Bảng `export_jobs`: metadata job export.
- Bảng `backup_records`: metadata backup dài hạn.
- RLS: `exports.download` đọc record, `exports.create` tạo record.
- Chưa chạy migration trên Supabase thật.

### Export status

- `family.json`: đã build từ people, families, family_parents, family_children, couple_relationships, tree_layouts và tree_layout_nodes.
- `family.ged`: foundation GEDCOM với HEAD/INDI/FAM/TRLR.
- `full-backup.zip`: dùng `jszip`, gồm `family.json`, `family.ged`, `manifest.json`, `checksums.json`.
- Manifest/checksum: schema version `1.0.0`, app version `0.1.0`, SHA-256.
- Media: chưa có media upload thật, `media_count = 0`.
- Import: chưa bật import ghi dữ liệu; chỉ giữ nguyên tắc docs.

### Permission/privacy status

- Download routes kiểm `exports.download` server-side.
- Export admin/internal có thể chứa dữ liệu đầy đủ theo quyền; không dùng làm public export.
- Nếu sau này cần public export, phải dùng privacy service/DTO public-safe.
- Không đưa service role key ra client.

### Script check đã tạo

- `npm run check:export-backup`

### Lệnh đã chạy

- Baseline trước khi sửa: `npm run check:foundation`, `npm run check:auth-permissions`, `npm run check:people`, `npm run check:relationships`, `npm run check:tree-viewer`, `npm run check:tree-editor`, `npm run check:public-privacy`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Phase 8: `npm run check:export-backup`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check` - PASS
- Browser route check `/admin/exports`, `/admin/exports/download/json`, `/admin/exports/download/gedcom`, `/admin/exports/download/zip` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3001` - PASS; download routes trả lỗi cấu hình an toàn khi thiếu Supabase config.
- `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` - WARN, còn 2 moderate warnings từ `next`/`postcss`; không chạy force fix vì breaking change ngoài scope.

### Chưa làm

- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa chạy migration trên Supabase thật.
- Chưa ghi `export_jobs`/`backup_records` vào DB runtime.
- Chưa làm import đầy đủ.
- Chưa làm media upload thật.
- Chưa làm export ảnh cây/PDF.
- Chưa kiểm thử với dữ liệu Supabase thật.
- NPM audit còn 2 moderate warnings từ `next`/`postcss`.

### Lưu ý cho AI tiếp theo

- Không bật import ghi dữ liệu nếu chưa có validation, preview, xác nhận và revision/import log.
- Không dùng admin export làm public export.
- Không bỏ `family.json`; GEDCOM không thay thế được JSON vì không giữ đủ dữ liệu riêng của hệ thống.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 9 - Revision history UI foundation.

## 2026-06-15 - Phase 7 Public/private mode foundation completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có public/private foundation. Public routes dùng privacy service và public-safe DTO, không đưa dữ liệu admin/private thẳng ra client.

### Public/privacy service đã có

- `lib/privacy/privacy-types.ts`
- `lib/privacy/privacy-service.ts`
- `lib/family/public-family-service.ts`

Privacy service có:

- `canShowPersonInMode`
- `toPublicPerson`
- `toFamilyPerson`
- `toAdminPerson`
- `sanitizePersonForMode`
- `sanitizeTreeGraphForMode`

### Public routes đã có

- `/`: public homepage.
- `/tree`: public readonly tree.
- `/people/[slug]`: public-safe person profile.
- `/admin/preview/public`: admin preview mô phỏng public tree.

### Public privacy behavior

- Public mode chỉ hiện người `visibility = public` và chưa xóa mềm.
- `PublicPerson` không có `notes_private`.
- Người còn sống public không hiện ngày sinh đầy đủ, ngày mất, nơi sinh, quê quán, ghi chú riêng tư hoặc dữ liệu nội bộ.
- Public tree được sanitize server-side trước khi truyền vào React Flow viewer.
- Admin preview dùng cùng public service với `/tree`.

### RLS/public query limitation

- Phase 7 không mở RLS public rộng.
- Public service dùng server-side anon Supabase client với query/filter `visibility = public`, `deleted_at is null`.
- Nếu database thật chưa có public-safe RLS policy, public routes có thể empty hoặc báo lỗi an toàn.
- Không dùng service role để build public pages trong Phase 7.

### Script check đã tạo

- `npm run check:public-privacy`

### Lệnh đã chạy

- Baseline: `npm run check:foundation`, `npm run check:auth-permissions`, `npm run check:people`, `npm run check:relationships`, `npm run check:tree-viewer`, `npm run check:tree-editor`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Phase 7: `npm run check:public-privacy`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Browser route check `/`, `/tree`, `/people/test-slug`, `/admin/preview/public` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3001` - PASS; các route render nội dung an toàn khi thiếu Supabase config.

### Chưa làm

- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa kiểm thử public routes với Supabase data thật.
- Chưa tạo public RLS policy/view/function riêng.
- Chưa làm export JSON/GEDCOM/ZIP thật.
- Chưa làm export ảnh/PDF.
- Chưa làm media upload thật.
- NPM audit còn 2 moderate warnings từ `next`/`postcss`.

### Lưu ý cho AI tiếp theo

- Không đưa `notes_private` vào public DTO.
- Không dựa vào CSS/UI để ẩn dữ liệu riêng tư.
- Nếu mở RLS public sau này, phải audit rất kỹ chỉ public-safe fields.
- Public tree/profile hiện dùng anon client; nếu DB policy chưa mở, fail/empty là expected-safe behavior.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 8 - Export/backup foundation:

- JSON export/import foundation.
- GEDCOM/ZIP planning hoặc export foundation.
- Không bỏ qua privacy/permission khi export.

## 2026-06-15 - Phase 6 Tree Editor foundation completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có Tree Editor foundation trong admin. Editor dùng React Flow, side panel và server actions để lưu layout UI riêng hoặc thêm quan hệ qua service thật.

### Migration/layout persistence đã tạo

- Migration: `db/migrations/20260614_0005_tree_layout_foundation.sql`
- Bảng `tree_layouts`: lưu layout tree theo scope.
- Bảng `tree_layout_nodes`: lưu vị trí node thủ công.
- RLS: `tree.view` đọc layout chưa xóa mềm, `tree.edit_layout` tạo/sửa/xóa mềm layout.
- Layout là dữ liệu UI, không thay thế relationship tables.

### Tree editor đã có

- Route: `/admin/tree/edit`
- Actions: `app/(admin)/admin/tree/edit/actions.ts`
- Layout service: `lib/family/tree-layout-service.ts`
- Components:
  - `components/tree/family-tree-editor.tsx`
  - `components/tree/tree-editor-side-panel.tsx`
  - `components/tree/tree-editor-toolbar.tsx`
- `/admin/tree` vẫn readonly và chỉ thêm link `Chỉnh sửa cây` khi có `tree.edit_layout`.

### Side panel/action status

- Click person node mở side panel.
- Side panel hiển thị họ tên, năm sinh/mất, đời, chi/nhánh, link hồ sơ và quan hệ tóm tắt.
- Có form thêm cha/mẹ, vợ/chồng/bạn đời, con bằng UUID người đã tồn tại.
- Add relationship từ cây dùng relationship service thật.
- Không tạo người mới từ cây trong Phase 6.

### Permission/privacy status

- `/admin/tree/edit` yêu cầu `tree.view` và `tree.edit_layout`.
- Save/reset layout yêu cầu `tree.edit_layout`.
- Add relationship yêu cầu `relationships.create` trong relationship service.
- Client editor không import service role/admin helper.
- Public tree chưa làm.

### Script check đã tạo

- `npm run check:tree-editor`

### Lệnh đã chạy

- Baseline: `npm run check:foundation`, `npm run check:auth-permissions`, `npm run check:people`, `npm run check:relationships`, `npm run check:tree-viewer`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Phase 6: `npm run check:tree-editor`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Browser route check `/admin/tree` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3001` - PASS, hiển thị thiếu cấu hình an toàn khi chưa có Supabase env thật.
- Browser route check `/admin/tree/edit` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3001` - PASS, hiển thị thiếu cấu hình an toàn khi chưa có Supabase env thật.

### Chưa làm

- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa chạy migration trên database thật.
- Chưa kiểm thử editor với Supabase data thật.
- Chưa làm public tree.
- Chưa export ảnh cây/PDF.
- Chưa làm JSON/GEDCOM/ZIP export thật.
- NPM audit còn 2 moderate warnings từ `next`/`postcss`.

### Lưu ý cho AI tiếp theo

- Không trộn layout tree với relationship data.
- Kéo node và lưu layout chỉ ghi `tree_layout_nodes`.
- Add relationship từ cây hiện tạo family unit nền rồi nối người đã tồn tại bằng UUID.
- Nếu thiếu Supabase env thật, `/admin/tree` và `/admin/tree/edit` phải fail an toàn, không dùng mock data.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 7 - Public/private mode foundation:

- Tạo public/internal surfaces.
- Lọc dữ liệu người còn sống và visibility server-side.
- Không chỉ ẩn dữ liệu private bằng UI.

## 2026-06-15 - Phase 5 Tree Viewer foundation completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có Tree Viewer foundation trong admin. Viewer dùng graph được build từ dữ liệu thật trong `people` và relationship tables, chưa có tree editor hoặc layout persistence.

### Package đã thêm

- `@xyflow/react`
- `elkjs`

### Tree graph/viewer đã có

- Types: `lib/family/tree-types.ts`
- Graph builder: `lib/family/tree-graph-builder.ts`
- Tree service: `lib/family/tree-service.ts`
- ELK layout helper: `lib/family/tree-layout-elk.ts`

- Edge kind: `family_unit`, `parent_child`, `couple`.
- Family node trung gian gom cha/mẹ và con.
- Node person không chứa `notes_private`.
- Builder có mode `admin`, `internal`, `public`; Phase 5 chỉ dùng admin route.

### Permission/privacy status

- `/admin/tree` yêu cầu `tree.view`.
- Tree service query server-side và trả graph đã build cho client viewer.
- Client viewer không import service role/admin helper.
- Public tree chưa làm trong Phase 5.

### Script check đã tạo

- `npm run check:tree-viewer`

### Lệnh đã chạy

- Baseline: `npm run check:foundation`, `npm run check:auth-permissions`, `npm run check:people`, `npm run check:relationships`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Phase 5: `npm run check:tree-viewer`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Browser route check `/admin/tree` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3001` - PASS, hiển thị thiếu cấu hình an toàn khi chưa có Supabase env thật.

- Tree editor/mutation từ cây là Phase 6, chưa có trong viewer.
- Nếu thiếu Supabase env thật, `/admin/tree` phải fail an toàn, không dùng mock data.
- Public tree cần lọc visibility server-side, không chỉ ẩn bằng UI.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 6 - Tree Editor foundation:

- Thêm edit interactions qua service/action có permission rõ ràng.
- Nếu lưu layout, dùng bảng `tree_layouts`, `tree_layout_nodes`, `tree_layout_edges` riêng.
- Không coi kéo node là sửa quan hệ gia phả thật.

## 2026-06-15 - Phase 4 Relationship CRUD foundation completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có Relationship CRUD foundation trong admin. Relationship data được lưu trong bảng riêng, có permission server-side, RLS, soft delete, revision và cycle check cơ bản.

### Relationship schema đã tạo

- Migration: `db/migrations/20260614_0004_relationship_foundation.sql`
- Bảng `families`: nhóm family với `family_code`, `family_label`, `visibility`, notes, audit và soft delete fields.
- Bảng `family_parents`: nối family với cha/mẹ/người nuôi bằng `parent_role` và `relationship_type`.
- Bảng `family_children`: nối family với con bằng `child_relationship_type`.
- Bảng `couple_relationships`: lưu quan hệ đôi với `relationship_status`, ngày bắt đầu/kết thúc, `visibility`, notes, audit và soft delete fields.

### Service/UI đã có

- `lib/family/relationship-service.ts`: list, summary theo person, create family, add parent/child, create/update couple, soft delete relationship records.
- `lib/family/relationship-graph.ts`: cycle check cha-con cơ bản.
- `lib/family/revision-service.ts`: helper revision dùng chung.
- `/admin/relationships`: danh sách family/couple, form tạo family, thêm cha/mẹ/con, tạo quan hệ đôi.
- `/admin/people/[id]`: có section Quan hệ gia đình.
- Admin nav có link `Quan hệ gia đình`.

### RLS/permission status

- Bật RLS cho `families`, `family_parents`, `family_children`, `couple_relationships`.
- `relationships.view` xem bản ghi chưa xóa mềm.
- `relationships.create` insert.
- `relationships.update`/`relationships.delete` update hoặc xóa mềm.
- Service layer vẫn enforce action-specific permission trước từng mutation.
- Không mở public-wide policy cho relationship tables.

### Script check đã tạo

- `npm run check:relationships`

### Lệnh đã chạy

- Baseline: `npm run check:foundation`, `npm run check:auth-permissions`, `npm run check:people`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Phase 4: `npm run check:relationships`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Browser route check `/admin/relationships` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3001` - PASS
- Browser route check `/admin/people/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3001` - PASS
- `git diff --check` - PASS

### Chưa làm

- Chưa làm media upload thật.
- Chưa làm export JSON/GEDCOM/ZIP thật.

### Lưu ý cho AI tiếp theo

- Không thêm `father_id`, `mother_id`, `spouse_id` vào `people`.
- Relationship UI hiện nhập UUID trực tiếp, chưa có autocomplete.
- Nếu thiếu Supabase env thật, relationship routes phải fail an toàn, không dùng mock data.
- Tree viewer/editor và layout graph là phase sau, không nằm trong Phase 4.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 5 - Tree viewer foundation:

- Đọc relationship tables để dựng dữ liệu cây.
- Chỉ cài React Flow/ELK khi phase tree cho phép.
- Không trộn dữ liệu layout cây với dữ liệu quan hệ thật.

## 2026-06-15 - Phase 3 People CRUD foundation completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có nền quản lý thành viên trong admin. Các route People CRUD foundation đã được tạo, dùng permission server-side và soft delete, chưa làm quan hệ gia đình hoặc cây gia phả.

### People schema đã tạo

- Migration: `db/migrations/20260614_0003_people_foundation.sql`
- Bảng `people` gồm identity, birth/death, place/branch, content/privacy, audit và soft delete fields.
- `visibility`: `public`, `family`, `private`.
- `gender`: `male`, `female`, `other`, `unknown`.
- Date precision: `exact`, `year_month`, `year`, `approximate`, `unknown`.

### Soft delete rule

- Không xóa cứng.
- Soft delete dùng `deleted_at`, `deleted_by`, `delete_reason`.
- Restore xóa các field soft-delete và ghi revision restore.

### Revision status

- Tạo foundation `revisions` và `revision_items`.

### RLS status

- Bật RLS cho `people`, `revisions`, `revision_items`.
- `people.view` xem bản ghi chưa xóa mềm.
- `people.create` insert.
- Update policy cho người có `people.update`, `people.delete`, hoặc `people.restore`.
- Service layer vẫn enforce action-specific permission trước từng mutation.
- Không mở public-wide policy cho `people`.

### CRUD route đã có

- `/admin/people`: danh sách, search, filter visibility/is_living.
- `/admin/people/new`: form thêm thành viên.
- `/admin/people/[id]`: xem/sửa, soft delete, restore.

### Script check đã tạo

- `npm run check:people`

### Lệnh đã chạy

- `npm run check:foundation` - PASS
- `npm run check:auth-permissions` - PASS
- `npm run check:people` - PASS
- `npm run typecheck` - PASS
- `npm run lint` - PASS
- `npm run build` - PASS
- Browser route check `/admin/people`, `/admin/people/new`, `/admin/people/[id]` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3001` - PASS

### Chưa làm

- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa chạy migration trên database thật.
- Chưa kiểm thử CRUD với Supabase project thật.
- Chưa làm Relationship CRUD.
- Chưa tạo `families`, `family_parents`, `family_children`, `couple_relationships`.
- Chưa làm cây gia phả.
- Chưa làm media upload thật.
- Chưa làm export JSON/GEDCOM/ZIP thật.

### Lưu ý cho AI tiếp theo

- Không xóa cứng people.
- Không thêm relationship vào `people`.
- Relationship CRUD phải dùng bảng quan hệ riêng ở phase sau.
- Service role vẫn chỉ dùng server-side.
- Nếu chưa có Supabase env thật, People UI phải fail an toàn, không dùng mock data.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 4 - Relationship CRUD foundation:

- Tạo `families`, `family_parents`, `family_children`, `couple_relationships`.
- Gắn permissions `relationships.*`.
- Kiểm tra vòng lặp dữ liệu cơ bản.
- Không làm React Flow/ELK tree viewer nếu chưa sang phase cây.

## 2026-06-14 - Phase 2 Auth + Role Permission hardening completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có auth/permission foundation server-side. Route `/admin` không còn là placeholder mở; route này yêu cầu user đăng nhập và có permission `people.view`.

### Auth flow đã chọn

- Supabase magic link theo email.
- Login UI tối giản tại `/auth/login`.
- Callback tại `/auth/callback`.
- Logout tại `/auth/logout`.
- Nếu thiếu cấu hình Supabase, login page hiển thị cảnh báo thay vì crash trắng.

### OWNER bootstrap đã chọn

- Không auto OWNER.
- User mới chỉ được bootstrap profile, không tự động có role admin.
- OWNER cần gán thủ công bằng SQL/admin context.
- Snippet: `db/snippets/assign-owner-role.sql`.

### Permission/admin guard

- Permission service server-side:
  - `lib/permissions/permission-service.ts`
  - `lib/permissions/require-permission.ts`
- Profile bootstrap:
  - `lib/auth/profile-service.ts`
- Quyền tối thiểu vào `/admin`: `people.view`.
- Nếu chưa đăng nhập: redirect `/auth/login`.
- Nếu đăng nhập nhưng thiếu quyền: redirect `/unauthorized`.

### Migration đã tạo

- `db/migrations/20260614_0002_auth_permission_hardening.sql`

Migration bổ sung:

- Bật lại RLS cho bảng nền.
- Recreate helper functions `current_profile_id()` và `has_permission(permission_code text)`.
- Cho authenticated user insert/update profile của chính mình.
- Cho user đọc role assignment và role permissions của chính mình.
- Thêm policy quản lý roles/permissions cho người có `permissions.manage`.
- Không mở public rộng cho bảng nhạy cảm.

### Script check đã tạo

- `npm run check:auth-permissions`

### Lệnh đã chạy

- `npm run check:foundation` - PASS
- `npm run check:auth-permissions` - PASS
- `npm run typecheck` - PASS
- `npm run lint` - PASS
- `npm run build` - PASS
- Browser route check `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`, `/unauthorized`, `/admin` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3001` - PASS

### Chưa làm

- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa tạo `.env` thật.
- Chưa kết nối Supabase project thật.
- Chưa chạy migration trên database thật.
- Chưa kiểm thử magic link với Supabase project thật.
- Chưa làm People CRUD.
- Chưa làm Relationship CRUD.
- Chưa làm cây gia phả.
- Chưa làm export JSON/GEDCOM/ZIP thật.

### Lưu ý cho AI tiếp theo

- Không đưa `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` vào client.
- Không tự động cấp OWNER nếu chưa có quyết định mới.
- `/admin` đang dùng `people.view` làm quyền vào cổng quản trị.
- Nếu cần OWNER đầu tiên, dùng `db/snippets/assign-owner-role.sql` sau khi profile đã tồn tại.
- Route guard và permission helper là server-side; không thay bằng kiểm tra UI.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 3 - People CRUD foundation:

- Tạo schema people theo docs.
- Xóa mềm/khôi phục, không xóa cứng.
- List/profile/search/filter thành viên.
- Gắn permission `people.*` vào service layer và UI.
- Không làm quan hệ/cây nếu chưa sang phase sau.

## 2026-06-14 - Phase 1 Project foundation completed
