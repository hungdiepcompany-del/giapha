# Next AI Handoff

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 122A-124A Export/Import Boundary And Portability Contract completed

- Added `docs/122A_EXPORT_BOUNDARY_DESIGN.md` for design-only export boundary:
  current foundation, `family.json`, GEDCOM, ZIP, media-later, data groups,
  privacy rules, main Worker limits and export-service/ZIP/GEDCOM approval
  gates.
- Added `docs/123A_IMPORT_BOUNDARY_DESIGN.md` for design-only import boundary:
  current safe preview foundation, import stages, validation groups, no direct
  production mutation and import-service/large-import approval gates.
- Added `docs/124A_DATA_PORTABILITY_BACKUP_COMPATIBILITY_CONTRACT.md` for
  canonical `family.json`, stable IDs, schema versioning, backward/forward
  compatibility, restore dry-run, manifest, lineage, media-later and
  warnings-later compatibility.
- Added `scripts/check-export-import-boundary-design.cjs` and
  `npm run check:export-import-boundary-design`.
- Decision 144 records that these docs are not runtime/schema/service approval.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker touched NO; runtime dependency added NO; new
  service Worker created NO; OpenNext/Wrangler config changed NO; large
  export/import/media work NO.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no SQL mutation, no
  seed/backfill, no large JSON/GEDCOM/ZIP runtime, no import parser runtime, no
  media export/import, no deploy and no push.
- Validation: export/import boundary design PASS; inline admin warning UI PASS;
  media-quality final readiness, static examples, static contracts and boundary
  design PASS; Vietnamese genealogy manual SQL diagnostic, domain UI and domain
  readiness PASS; env-safe PASS; migrations PASS; typecheck PASS; lint PASS;
  clean temp `npm run build` PASS; Git whitespace checks PASS.
- Workspace-root build remains blocked before compile by the pre-existing
  Windows `.next` ACL `EPERM` unlink error. The clean temp copy build passed
  with `.git`, `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` were not read;
  `PLANNING.MD` was not committed.
- Recommended next path: Phase 122B/123B/124B static examples/checklists, or a
  separately owner-approved service-boundary design phase.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 121B Inline Warning UI Post-Integration Smoke completed

- Completed post-integration smoke/review after commit `86d4ad6`.
- Admin smoke: `/admin/genealogy` with no effective permissions failed closed,
  showing the existing permission message and no fake warning data.
- Public smoke: `/tree` showed no admin warning panel/copy and no console
  warning/error.
- UI/copy review passed: labels remain `Thông tin`, `Cảnh báo`, `Cần xử lý`;
  warning cards include an actionable next step and safe empty-state copy.
- Privacy review passed: warning copy does not expose `notes_private`,
  `source_note`, hidden relationship facts, credentials, media/storage details
  or raw source material.
- Hardened `scripts/check-inline-admin-warning-ui.cjs` to scan public
  route/component source for admin warning imports/helpers and persistent
  warning references.
- Added `docs/121B_INLINE_WARNING_UI_POST_INTEGRATION_SMOKE.md`.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker touched only by checker/doc hardening in this
  phase; runtime dependency added NO; new service Worker created NO;
  OpenNext/Wrangler config changed NO; heavy scan/media/export/import work NO.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no SQL mutation, no
  seed/backfill, no persistent warning table, no full-tree scan, no media work,
  no deploy and no push.
- Validation: inline admin warning UI PASS; media-quality final readiness,
  static examples, static contracts and boundary design PASS; Vietnamese
  genealogy manual SQL diagnostic, domain UI and domain readiness PASS;
  env-safe PASS; migrations PASS; typecheck PASS; lint PASS; clean temp
  `npm run build` PASS; Git whitespace checks PASS.
- Workspace-root build remains blocked before compile by the pre-existing
  Windows `.next` ACL `EPERM` unlink error. The clean temp copy build passed
  with `.git`, `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` were not read;
  `PLANNING.MD` was not committed.
- Recommended next path: keep media, persistent warnings and heavy scans
  deferred; require separate owner approval for any schema, service Worker,
  media, export/import or broader runtime phase.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 121A Lightweight Inline Admin Warning UI completed

- Owner-approved Option D was implemented only as deterministic inline admin
  hints from data already loaded on person, genealogy, membership and selected
  tree-node surfaces.
- Added reusable Vietnamese warning badge/list UI and pure warning-rule
  helpers; no warning query, persistence, background job or full-tree scan was
  introduced.
- Admin people warnings cover incomplete identity, invalid date order,
  living-person public visibility, multiple primary memberships, incomplete
  lineage assignment and lineage scope conflicts.
- Admin genealogy warnings summarize the already-loaded memberships; the tree
  editor only evaluates the selected loaded person node.
- Warning UI remains inside existing admin permission boundaries, does not
  expose private notes/source notes and is not present on public routes.
- Added `docs/121A_INLINE_ADMIN_WARNING_UI.md`,
  `scripts/check-inline-admin-warning-ui.cjs` and
  `npm run check:inline-admin-warning-ui`.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker receives only the small existing-app component
  and helper code; runtime dependency added NO; new service Worker created NO;
  OpenNext/Wrangler config changed NO; heavy scan/media/export/import work NO.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql`, no DB apply, no SQL mutation, no
  seed/backfill, no persistent warning table, no full-tree scan, no media work,
  no deploy and no push.
- Validation: inline admin warning UI PASS; media-quality final readiness,
  static examples, static contracts and boundary design PASS; Vietnamese
  genealogy manual SQL diagnostic, domain UI and domain readiness PASS;
  env-safe PASS; migrations PASS; typecheck PASS; lint PASS; clean temp
  `npm run build` PASS; Git whitespace checks PASS.
- Workspace-root build remains blocked before compile by the pre-existing
  Windows `.next` ACL `EPERM` unlink error. The clean temp copy build passed
  with `.git`, `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` were not read;
  `PLANNING.MD` was not committed.
- Recommended next path: keep media, persistent warnings and heavy scans
  deferred; require separate owner approval for any Phase 121B schema, service
  or broader runtime scope.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 118D-120D Vietnamese Genealogy Media/Data Quality Final Readiness completed

- Completed final docs-only readiness/signoff review after commit `3bc3847`.
- Created `docs/118D_120D_MEDIA_QUALITY_FINAL_READINESS_REVIEW.md` with Phase 118D media review, Phase 119D data-quality review, Phase 120D admin warning UX review, decision matrix, owner approvals and no-go conditions.
- Decision matrix result: option A defer all implementation is `RECOMMENDED_DEFAULT`.
- Option D inline admin warning UI is `CONDITIONALLY_READY` only through a separate explicit owner-approved lightweight runtime phase with no schema, persistence, heavy scan, Worker, dependency or config change.
- Options B/C are ready only for separately approved docs/static schema-candidate phases; options E/F are ready only for separately approved service design phases, not Worker implementation.
- Added `scripts/check-media-quality-final-readiness.cjs` and `npm run check:media-quality-final-readiness`.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker touched NO; runtime dependency added NO; new service Worker created NO; OpenNext/Wrangler config changed NO; Worker size risk introduced NO.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql` file, no DB apply, no SQL mutation, no seed/backfill, no media upload/storage bucket, no thumbnail/image processing, no persistent warning table, no full-tree runtime scan, no runtime warning UI, no large export/import/GEDCOM/ZIP, no deploy and no push.
- Validation: final readiness checker PASS, static examples/contracts/boundary checkers PASS, Phase 103-120D Vietnamese genealogy static checkers PASS, env-safe PASS, migrations PASS, typecheck PASS, lint PASS, clean temp `npm run build` PASS, `git diff --check` PASS and `git diff --cached --check` PASS.
- Note for next AI: workspace-root `npm run build` remains blocked before compile by pre-existing Windows `.next` artifact ACL error `EPERM: operation not permitted, unlink 'D:\CODE\GIA PHẢ\.next\build\56416d4ae4ce586f.js'`; clean temp copy build passed with `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- Note for next AI: this final readiness review is a decision gate, not approval for any option B-F. Require explicit owner approval naming the selected path.
- `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` were not read; `PLANNING.MD` was not committed.
- Recommended next path: keep option A, or request explicit owner approval for a narrowly scoped option D phase.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 118C-120C Vietnamese Genealogy Media/Data Quality Acceptance Examples completed

- Grouped Phase 118C, 119C and 120C completed locally as docs/static examples and acceptance checklists after commit `7f794d7`.

- Phase 120C result: created `docs/120C_ADMIN_WARNING_UX_ACCEPTANCE_CHECKLIST.md` with acceptance criteria for people, genealogy, tree editor, future import/export warning surfaces, copy, accessibility and privacy.
- Added `scripts/check-media-quality-static-examples.cjs` and `npm run check:media-quality-static-examples`.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker touched NO; runtime dependency added NO; new service Worker created NO; OpenNext/Wrangler config changed NO; Worker size risk introduced NO.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql` file, no DB apply, no SQL mutation, no seed/backfill, no media upload/storage bucket, no thumbnail/image processing, no persistent warning table, no full-tree runtime scan, no runtime warning UI, no large export/import/GEDCOM/ZIP, no deploy and no push.
- Validation: media/data-quality static examples checker PASS, static contracts checker PASS, boundary design checker PASS, Phase 103-120C Vietnamese genealogy static checkers PASS, env-safe PASS, migrations PASS, typecheck PASS, lint PASS, clean temp `npm run build` PASS, `git diff --check` PASS and `git diff --cached --check` PASS.
- Note for next AI: workspace-root `npm run build` remains blocked before compile by pre-existing Windows `.next` artifact ACL error `EPERM: operation not permitted, unlink 'D:\CODE\GIA PHẢ\.next\build\56416d4ae4ce586f.js'`; clean temp copy build passed with `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- Note for next AI: static examples are acceptance evidence only. They are not fixtures, runtime data, schema authorization or service/Worker approval.
- `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` were not read; `PLANNING.MD` was not committed.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 118D/119D/120D review-only refinement, or a separately owner-approved schema/service/runtime candidate phase.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 118B-120B Vietnamese Genealogy Media/Data Quality Static Contracts completed

- Grouped Phase 118B, 119B and 120B completed locally as docs/static contract and approval-gate work after commit `a436cfa`.
- Phase 118B result: created `docs/118B_MEDIA_STATIC_CONTRACT_AND_APPROVAL_GATE.md` for future media metadata concepts, storage contract fields, privacy contract, media-service boundary and approval gates before media migration or media-service Worker.
- Phase 119B result: created `docs/119B_DATA_QUALITY_STATIC_CONTRACT_AND_APPROVAL_GATE.md` for warning categories, severity contract, future warning shape, privacy boundary and approval gates before persistent warning migration or quality-service Worker.
- Phase 120B result: created `docs/120B_ADMIN_WARNING_UX_STATIC_CONTRACT.md` for admin warning locations, Vietnamese labels, UX states, privacy-safe copy, accessibility/basic UI rules and schema/service boundaries.
- Added `scripts/check-media-quality-static-contracts.cjs` and `npm run check:media-quality-static-contracts`.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker touched NO; runtime dependency added NO; new service Worker created NO; OpenNext/Wrangler config changed NO; Worker size risk introduced NO.

- Validation: media/data-quality static contracts checker PASS, media/data-quality boundary checker PASS, Phase 103-120B Vietnamese genealogy static checkers PASS, env-safe PASS, migrations PASS, typecheck PASS, lint PASS, clean temp `npm run build` PASS, `git diff --check` PASS and `git diff --cached --check` PASS.
- Note for next AI: workspace-root `npm run build` remains blocked before compile by pre-existing Windows `.next` artifact ACL error `EPERM: operation not permitted, unlink 'D:\CODE\GIA PHẢ\.next\build\56416d4ae4ce586f.js'`; clean temp copy build passed with `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- Note for next AI: these contracts are approval gates, not implementation permission. Any future media migration, storage provider activation, media-service Worker, persistent warning table, full-tree quality scan, import preview scan or export-readiness scan needs separate owner-approved phase.
- `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` were not read; `PLANNING.MD` was not committed.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 118C/119C/120C static examples and acceptance checklists, or a separately owner-approved schema/service candidate phase.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 118A-120A Vietnamese Genealogy Media/Data Quality Boundary Design completed

- Grouped Phase 118A, 119A and 120A completed locally as design-only boundary planning after Phase 117A commit `4a3f45038950f18d6e9bdf680d4c66de171b5e3e`.
- Phase 118A result: created `docs/118A_MEDIA_DOMAIN_STORAGE_BOUNDARY_DESIGN.md` for media domain/storage boundary, portraits, grave/tombstone photos, family documents/photos, branch/clan documents, event photos, metadata concepts, privacy and future storage/service gates.
- Phase 119A result: created `docs/119A_DATA_QUALITY_BOUNDARY_WARNING_DESIGN.md` for data-quality warning categories, severity, admin display locations, privacy and service-boundary split.
- Phase 120A result: created `docs/120A_ADMIN_WARNING_UX_PLANNING.md` for admin warning UX principles, Vietnamese severity labels, empty states, privacy-safe behavior and deferred runtime work.
- Added `scripts/check-media-quality-boundary-design.cjs` and `npm run check:media-quality-boundary-design`.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker touched NO; runtime dependency added NO; new service Worker created NO; OpenNext/Wrangler config changed NO; Worker size risk introduced NO.
- Boundary: no migration, no `.sql` file, no DB apply, no SQL mutation, no seed/backfill, no media upload/storage bucket, no real image/video/file processing, no thumbnail generation, no large export/import/GEDCOM/ZIP, no deploy and no push.
- Validation: media/data-quality boundary checker PASS, Phase 103-120A Vietnamese genealogy static checkers PASS, env-safe PASS, migrations PASS, typecheck PASS, lint PASS, clean temp `npm run build` PASS, `git diff --check` PASS and `git diff --cached --check` PASS.
- Note for next AI: workspace-root `npm run build` remains blocked before compile by pre-existing Windows `.next` artifact ACL error `EPERM: operation not permitted, unlink 'D:\CODE\GIA PHẢ\.next\build\56416d4ae4ce586f.js'`; clean temp copy build passed with `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- Note for next AI: `docs/RUNTIME_WORKER_GUARDRAIL.md` and `docs/SERVICE_BOUNDARY_ROADMAP.md` remain mandatory before any future media upload/storage, large data-quality scan, import preview, GEDCOM/ZIP, new Worker, dependency or deploy/config work.
- `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` were not read; `PLANNING.MD` was not committed.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 118B/119B/120B static contract/checklist work, or owner-approved Phase 121 only if it explicitly stays within boundary gates.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 117A Vietnamese Genealogy Admin UX Polish completed

- Phase 117A completed locally as a scoped polish pass after grouped Phase 114-117 commit `22aff0f28e3f361a13e79cca831dd7935eb7ac45`.
- UX polish: admin genealogy dashboard/routes now use clearer Vietnamese labels and saved messages; empty states include next-step links.
- Form polish: clan, branch, generation rule and membership forms now have clearer Vietnamese labels, placeholders and helper text.
- Validation polish: required-field validation returns Vietnamese messages; duplicate/unique and foreign-key action errors are mapped to clearer user-facing copy.
- Double-submit guard: genealogy submit buttons use `useFormStatus` pending labels without adding dependencies.
- Person membership UX: person detail lineage section now explains explicit lineage-table assignment and warns when a clan prerequisite is missing.
- Tree display: admin tree cards label lineage display as `Dòng họ` and `Chi`, preferring lineage branch metadata when present.
- Public privacy remains conservative: public routes still do not query lineage tables, sanitizer still clears lineage fields unless public-visible and not living, and source/private/family-only membership data is not exposed publicly.
- Created `docs/117A_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_ADMIN_UX_POLISH.md` and updated `docs/00_INDEX.md`.
- Updated `scripts/check-vietnamese-genealogy-domain-ui.cjs` to cover Phase 117A doc/polish markers and public privacy guard continuity.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker touched YES for lightweight admin UI polish only; runtime dependency added NO; new service Worker created NO; OpenNext/Wrangler config changed NO; Worker size risk LOW.
- Validation: Phase 103-117A Vietnamese genealogy static checkers PASS, env-safe PASS, migrations PASS, typecheck PASS, lint PASS, clean temp `npm run build` PASS, `git diff --check` PASS and `git diff --cached --check` PASS.
- Note for next AI: workspace-root `npm run build` remains blocked before compile by pre-existing Windows `.next` artifact ACL error `EPERM: operation not permitted, unlink 'D:\CODE\GIA PHẢ\.next\build\56416d4ae4ce586f.js'`; clean temp copy build passed with `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- Boundary: no migration, no DB apply, no SQL mutation, no seed/backfill, no excluded runtime tables, no media/upload/storage, no large export/import/GEDCOM/ZIP, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no deploy, no push and `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` not read.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 118A Media Domain and Storage Boundary Design.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 114-117 Vietnamese Genealogy Domain UI Integration completed

- Grouped Phase 114-117 completed locally after Phase 113C `PASS_MANUAL_SQL_DIAGNOSTIC`.
- Phase 114 result: added server-only lineage types, validation and service layer for `clans`, `clan_branches`, `generation_rules` and `person_branch_memberships`.
- Phase 115 result: added admin routes `/admin/genealogy`, `/admin/genealogy/clans`, `/admin/genealogy/branches`, `/admin/genealogy/generation-rules` and `/admin/genealogy/memberships`.
- Phase 116 result: person detail pages now show branch membership and include an explicit assignment form when the user has an existing manage permission.
- Phase 117 result: admin tree can display lineage membership data; public sanitizer clears lineage fields unless future lineage data is public-visible and the person is not living. Public routes do not query lineage tables in this phase.
- Permissions used: read via `people.view` or `tree.view`; manage via `people.update`, `relationships.update`, `tree.edit_layout` or `settings.manage`.
- Created `docs/114_117_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_DOMAIN_UI_INTEGRATION.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-vietnamese-genealogy-domain-ui.cjs` and `npm run check:vietnamese-genealogy-domain-ui`.
- Updated `docs/00_INDEX.md`, `docs/08_AI_WORK_LOG.md` and `docs/09_DECISION_LOG.md`.
- Worker/runtime: main Worker touched YES for lightweight admin CRUD/UI only; runtime dependency added NO; new service Worker created NO; OpenNext/Wrangler config changed NO; Worker size risk LOW.
- Validation: Phase 103-117 Vietnamese genealogy static checkers PASS, env-safe PASS, migrations PASS, typecheck PASS, lint PASS, clean temp `npm run build` PASS, `git diff --check` PASS and `git diff --cached --check` PASS.
- Note for next AI: workspace-root `npm run build` is blocked before compile by pre-existing Windows `.next` artifact ACL error `EPERM: operation not permitted, unlink 'D:\CODE\GIA PHẢ\.next\build\56416d4ae4ce586f.js'`; clean temp copy build passed with `.next`, env files and `PLANNING.MD` excluded.
- Deferred: export/import/GEDCOM/ZIP/media/data-quality work remains boundary-governed and not implemented here.
- Boundary: no migration created, no DB apply, no SQL mutation by Codex, no seed/backfill, no automatic backfill from `people.branch_name` or `people.generation_number`, no excluded tables used, no media/upload/storage, no large export/import/GEDCOM/ZIP, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no deploy, no push and `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` not read.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 118A Media Domain and Storage Boundary Design, or a focused Phase 117A UX polish pass for genealogy admin selectors.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 113C Vietnamese Genealogy Manual SQL Diagnostic PASS recorded

- Phase 113C recorded owner/operator-provided manual read-only SQL diagnostic PASS from Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor.
- Target Supabase project ref: `frkyeuxrlcflmsxxsolp`.
- Migration file: `db/migrations/20260618_0008_vietnamese_genealogy_first_migration.sql`.
- Final DB verification status: `PASS_MANUAL_SQL_DIAGNOSTIC`.
- Credential verifier status: `REST_VERIFIER_NOT_USED_FOR_PASS`.
- Required tables result: PASS for `clans`, `clan_branches`, `generation_rules` and `person_branch_memberships`.
- Excluded tables result: PASS; `person_names`, `person_life_events`, `person_burials` and `person_media` do not exist per owner/operator diagnostic.
- Existing core tables result: PASS for `people`, `families`, `family_parents`, `family_children` and `couple_relationships`.
- RLS result: PASS; owner/operator diagnostic confirmed RLS enabled on all four new lineage tables.
- Policies result: PASS; owner/operator diagnostic confirmed policies exist for all four new lineage tables.
- No seed/backfill result: PASS; owner/operator diagnostic confirmed zero rows in all four new lineage tables.
- Created `docs/113C_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_MANUAL_SQL_DIAGNOSTIC_PASS.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-vietnamese-genealogy-manual-sql-diagnostic-pass.cjs` and `npm run check:vietnamese-genealogy-manual-sql-diagnostic-pass`.
- Security note remains active: service role key material was previously exposed in chat and must be rotated or revoked before future credential-assisted verification. Do not repeat, request, write or commit credential values.
- Boundary: no DB apply by Codex, no migration rerun, no SQL execution by Codex, no SQL mutation, no seed/backfill, no migration file change, no new migration, no runtime app code change, no UI change, no deploy, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no push and `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and `PLANNING.MD` not read.
- Recommended next phase: grouped Phase 114-117 can start.

## 2026-06-19 - Phase 113B-fix Vietnamese Genealogy Verification Diagnostic completed

- Phase 113B-fix handled owner-provided PowerShell verifier output that returned `FAIL`, not PASS.
- Current DB verification status: `NOT_VERIFIED`; do not record PASS from the current evidence.
- Required REST table checks failed for `clans`, `clan_branches`, `generation_rules` and `person_branch_memberships`.
- RLS result: not verified by REST-only verifier; needs SQL metadata evidence.
- Policy result: not verified by REST-only verifier; needs `pg_policies` evidence.
- Excluded scope result: not fully proven by current evidence; needs sanitized SQL output showing `person_names`, `person_life_events`, `person_burials` and `person_media` are absent.
- No seed/backfill result: not proven; needs read-only row-count SQL output for the four lineage tables.
- Existing table safety result: not proven; needs sanitized SQL output showing `people`, `families`, `family_parents`, `family_children` and `couple_relationships` still exist.
- Added `docs/113B_FIX_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_VERIFICATION_DIAGNOSTIC.md` with diagnostic hypotheses and manual Supabase Dashboard read-only SQL checks.
- Hardened `scripts/verify-vietnamese-genealogy-migration-post-apply.cjs` to classify table failures, verify expected project ref shape, check existing core table REST readability and avoid claiming RLS/policy PASS from REST-only evidence.
- Added `scripts/check-vietnamese-genealogy-verification-diagnostic.cjs` and `npm run check:vietnamese-genealogy-verification-diagnostic`.
- Security note: service role key material was exposed in chat by the owner/operator. The exposed key must be rotated or revoked before further credential-assisted verification. Do not repeat, request, write or commit credential values.
- Boundary: no DB apply, no migration rerun, no SQL mutation, no seed/backfill, no migration file modification, no new migration, no runtime app code change, no UI change, no deploy, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no push and `PLANNING.MD` not read or committed.
- No-go before Phase 114-117: required tables, RLS, policies, excluded scope, no seed/backfill and existing core table safety must be proven by sanitized SQL evidence, or the owner must explicitly accept proceeding with the limitation recorded.
- Recommended next step: owner rotates/revokes the exposed key, then runs the manual SQL checklist in Supabase Dashboard for project `frkyeuxrlcflmsxxsolp` and provides sanitized results.

## 2026-06-18 - Phase 113B Vietnamese Genealogy Credential Verification recorded

- Phase 113B attempted credential-assisted read-only post-apply verification.
- Explicit verification env was missing: `VIET_GENEALOGY_VERIFY_SUPABASE_URL`, `VIET_GENEALOGY_VERIFY_SUPABASE_SERVER_KEY` and `VIET_GENEALOGY_VERIFY_MODE=read_only`.
- Verifier result: `SKIPPED_MISSING_EXPLICIT_VERIFICATION_CREDENTIALS`.
- Final verification status: `PASS_WITH_SAFE_SKIP`.
- Created `docs/113B_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_CREDENTIAL_VERIFICATION.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-vietnamese-genealogy-credential-verification.cjs` and `npm run check:vietnamese-genealogy-credential-verification`.
- Required tables result: not independently DB-verified due missing env.
- RLS result: not independently DB-verified due missing env.
- Policy result: not independently DB-verified due missing env.
- Excluded scope result: not independently DB-verified due missing env.
- No seed/backfill result: not independently DB-verified due missing env.
- Existing table safety result: not independently DB-verified due missing env.
- Static source review remains unchanged: migration creates only `clans`, `clan_branches`, `generation_rules` and `person_branch_memberships`, enables RLS, uses existing permissions and includes no seed/backfill.
- Boundary: no DB apply, no migration rerun, no SQL mutation, no seed/backfill, no migration file modification, no new migration, no deploy, no runtime app code change, no UI change, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no push and `PLANNING.MD` not read or committed.
- Validation: verifier PASS_WITH_SAFE_SKIP, Phase 113B checker PASS, Phase 103-113A checkers PASS, env-safe PASS, migrations PASS, typecheck PASS, lint PASS, `git diff --check` PASS and `git diff --cached --check` PASS.
- Recommended next phase: provide shell-only verification env and rerun credential-assisted verification before Phase 114-117. Phase 114-117 remains not recommended after this safe-skip.

- RLS/policy DB verification status: `SKIPPED_MISSING_EXPLICIT_VERIFICATION_CREDENTIALS`.
- Excluded-scope DB verification status: `SKIPPED_MISSING_EXPLICIT_VERIFICATION_CREDENTIALS`.
- Static source review remains unchanged: migration creates only `clans`, `clan_branches`, `generation_rules` and `person_branch_memberships`, enables RLS, uses existing permissions and includes no seed/backfill.
- Boundary: no DB apply run by AI/local, no migration rerun, no SQL mutation executed by AI/local, no seed/backfill, no migration file modification, no new migration, no deploy, no runtime app code change, no UI change, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no push and `PLANNING.MD` not read or committed.

- Recommended next phase: Phase 113B Credential-Assisted Vietnamese Genealogy Read-Only DB Verification before Phase 114-117. If the owner accepts owner-confirmation-only evidence, Phase 114-117 grouped prompt can start with this limitation recorded.

## 2026-06-18 - Phase 113 Vietnamese Genealogy Migration Apply Execution recorded

- Owner approval received for DB apply of `db/migrations/20260618_0008_vietnamese_genealogy_first_migration.sql`.
- Target Supabase project ref: `frkyeuxrlcflmsxxsolp`.
- DB backup/snapshot: `DONE`.
- Expected SHA256: `522B11AF4D8BDA4F1E29AB63C49C9718129ADF1B27F3F2119BB40D9F7214EA5F`.
- Actual SHA256: `522B11AF4D8BDA4F1E29AB63C49C9718129ADF1B27F3F2119BB40D9F7214EA5F`.
- Pre-apply local/static checks passed.
- Local Supabase project ref file matched `frkyeuxrlcflmsxxsolp`, but Supabase CLI was not available in PATH and `.env.local` was missing.
- Apply result: `OWNER_ACTION_REQUIRED`; Codex did not run local DB apply.
- Required owner/operator action: manually apply exactly the approved migration file through a controlled Supabase Dashboard or equivalent one-file-only path, then record the result.
- DB verification result: `NOT_RUN_APPLY_NOT_CONFIRMED`; read-only post-apply verification still needs to confirm tables, RLS, policies, no old table drift, no excluded tables, no seed rows and no backfill.
- Created `docs/113_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_MIGRATION_APPLY_EXECUTION.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-vietnamese-genealogy-migration-apply-execution.cjs` and `npm run check:vietnamese-genealogy-migration-apply-execution`.
- Boundary: no migration file modification, no extra migration, no extra SQL executed, no seed data, no production data mutation, no backfill from `people.branch_name`, no backfill from `people.generation_number`, no deploy, no runtime app code change, no UI change, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no push and `PLANNING.MD` not read or committed.
- Validation: genealogy domain/schema/scope/real-migration/readiness/apply-execution checkers PASS, env-safe PASS, migrations PASS, typecheck PASS, lint PASS, `git diff --check` PASS and `git diff --cached --check` PASS.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 113A Owner Manual Apply Result Capture And Read-Only Verification. Phase 114-117 should wait until apply confirmation and read-only verification are recorded.

## 2026-06-18 - Phase 112 Vietnamese Genealogy Migration Apply Readiness completed

- Created `docs/112_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_MIGRATION_APPLY_READINESS.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-vietnamese-genealogy-migration-apply-readiness.cjs` and `npm run check:vietnamese-genealogy-migration-apply-readiness`.
- Reviewed migration file `db/migrations/20260618_0008_vietnamese_genealogy_first_migration.sql` without modifying it.
- Migration fingerprint recorded: SHA256 `522B11AF4D8BDA4F1E29AB63C49C9718129ADF1B27F3F2119BB40D9F7214EA5F`.
- Readiness result: `READY_FOR_PHASE_113_APPROVAL_REQUEST`.
- Apply status remains `NOT_APPLIED`.
- Required before Phase 113: explicit owner approval for DB apply, correct Supabase project ref, current DB backup/snapshot, migration path confirmation, checksum comparison, RLS review, rollback owner/path and post-apply verification plan.
- No-go: wrong/unconfirmed project, missing backup, unclear rollback, failing migration/readiness checker, out-of-scope migration contents, unclear RLS/privacy or missing Phase 113 owner approval.
- Post-apply verification plan: verify tables, RLS, policies, unchanged old tables, build/runtime surfaces and no Worker/runtime changes.
- Worker/runtime: no main Worker touch, no runtime dependency, no service Worker, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change and no Worker size risk.
- Boundary: no DB apply, no SQL executed, no Supabase command run, no production data mutation, no migration file modified, no new migration created, no deploy, no runtime app code change, no UI change, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no push and `PLANNING.MD` not read or committed.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 113 only if owner explicitly approves DB apply.

## 2026-06-18 - Phase 111 Vietnamese Genealogy Real Migration File completed

- Owner approved Phase 111 real migration file creation only.
- Created migration file `db/migrations/20260618_0008_vietnamese_genealogy_first_migration.sql`.
- Created `docs/111_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_REAL_MIGRATION_FILE.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-vietnamese-genealogy-real-migration-file.cjs` and `npm run check:vietnamese-genealogy-real-migration-file`.
- Approved tables included: `clans`, `clan_branches`, `generation_rules`, `person_branch_memberships`.
- Explicitly excluded: `person_names`, `person_life_events`, `person_burials`, `person_media`, media processing, large export/import/GEDCOM/ZIP work, runtime app changes, Worker/service creation, DB apply, seed data and automatic backfill from `people.branch_name` or `people.generation_number`.
- RLS/privacy: all four new tables have RLS enabled from creation. Policies use existing permissions only: read via `people.view` or `tree.view`; insert/update via `people.update`, `relationships.update`, `tree.edit_layout` or `settings.manage`. No public-wide direct table access was added.
- Export/import follow-up: future `family.json` support must preserve clan, branch, generation rule and membership rows with stable IDs and reference validation; GEDCOM remains partial/JSON-first.
- Worker/runtime: no main Worker touch, no runtime dependency, no service Worker, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change and no Worker size risk.
- Apply status: `NOT_APPLIED`.
- Boundary: no DB apply, no SQL executed, no production data mutation, no deploy, no runtime app code change, no UI change, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no push and `PLANNING.MD` not read or committed.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 112 Domain Migration Apply Readiness.

## 2026-06-18 - Phase 110B Vietnamese Genealogy First Migration Scope completed

- Created `docs/110B_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_FIRST_MIGRATION_SCOPE.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-vietnamese-genealogy-first-migration-scope.cjs` and `npm run check:vietnamese-genealogy-first-migration-scope`.
- Current status: `PHASE_111_NOT_APPROVED`.
- Required marker: `OWNER_APPROVAL_REQUIRED_BEFORE_PHASE_111_REAL_MIGRATION_FILE=true`.
- Final proposed first migration scope if owner approves later: `clans`, `clan_branches`, `generation_rules`, `person_branch_memberships`.
- Optional owner decision: include or defer `person_names`.
- Deferred from first migration: `person_life_events`, `person_burials`, `person_media`, media processing, large export/import/GEDCOM/ZIP work, runtime app changes, Worker/service creation, DB apply and automatic backfill from `people.branch_name`.
- Privacy/RLS: all allowed first-migration tables must have RLS enabled; public output must remain filtered through server-side privacy rules.
- Export/import: allowed tables must eventually be preserved in `family.json`; GEDCOM remains partial and JSON-first for clan/branch/generation metadata.
- Worker/runtime: no main Worker touch, no runtime dependency, no service Worker, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change and no Worker size risk.
- Boundary: no real migration file, no DB apply, no SQL executed, no deploy, no runtime app change, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no push and `PLANNING.MD` not read or committed.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 111 only if owner explicitly approves real migration file creation and answers the open scope questions.

## 2026-06-18 - Phase 108-110 Schema Candidate Owner Review completed

- Created `docs/108_110_SCHEMA_CANDIDATE_OWNER_REVIEW.md`.
- Review result: Phase 108-110 candidate is directionally sound but should not proceed directly to Phase 111 without scope and policy decisions.
- Recommended owner decision: `REQUEST_CHANGES_BEFORE_PHASE_111`.
- Proposed first migration scope if owner approves later: `clans`, `clan_branches`, `generation_rules`, `person_branch_memberships`; `person_names` is optional only if owner confirms immediate need.
- Deferred from first migration: `person_life_events`, `person_burials`, `person_media`, media processing, large export/import/GEDCOM/ZIP work and runtime changes.
- Boundary: no real migration file, no DB apply, no SQL executed, no deploy, no runtime app change, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no package added, no push and `PLANNING.MD` not committed.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 111 only if owner approves real migration file creation after review changes/questions are resolved.

## 2026-06-18 - Phase 108-110 Vietnamese Genealogy Schema Candidate Gate completed

- Created `docs/108_110_VIETNAMESE_GENEALOGY_SCHEMA_CANDIDATE.md` for schema strategy, candidate tables/fields, compatibility, worker boundary notes and real migration approval gate.
- Added `scripts/check-vietnamese-genealogy-schema-candidate.cjs` and `npm run check:vietnamese-genealogy-schema-candidate`.
- Candidate recommendation: normalize `clans`, `clan_branches`, `generation_rules`, `person_branch_memberships` and `person_names` first; defer `person_life_events` and `person_burials` to recommended next; keep `person_media` later until Phase 118A media/storage boundary design.
- Phase 110 remains approval-only: no real migration file, no DB apply and no SQL execution.
- Boundary: no deploy, no runtime app change, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no runtime dependency added, no push and `PLANNING.MD` not committed.
- Recommended next phase: review schema candidate; start Phase 111 only if owner approves real migration file creation.

## 2026-06-18 - Phase 103-107 Vietnamese Genealogy Domain Guardrail Hardening completed

- Phase 103-107 docs were hardened so `Required Now` cannot be mistaken for authorization to create schema, migration, DB apply, runtime, UI, service Worker or production changes.
- Phase 104 priority wording now uses `Specification Required Now`, with a nearby note clarifying it means specification/readiness only.
- Added cross-references to `docs/RUNTIME_WORKER_GUARDRAIL.md` and `docs/SERVICE_BOUNDARY_ROADMAP.md` for large export/import/media/GEDCOM/ZIP processing.
- Added runtime and Worker boundary status checklist to the Phase 103-107 bundle.
- Boundary: no migration, no DB apply, no deploy, no runtime app change, no Worker created, no OpenNext/Wrangler config change, no package added, no push.
- Recommended next phase: Phase 108-110 Vietnamese Genealogy Schema Candidate Design / Static Safety Check / Approval Gate.

## 2026-06-18 - Runtime Worker Guardrail and Service Boundary Roadmap docs prepared

- Created `docs/RUNTIME_WORKER_GUARDRAIL.md` to keep the main Cloudflare/OpenNext Worker small and prevent heavy runtime/dependency drift.
- Created `docs/SERVICE_BOUNDARY_ROADMAP.md` to map main app, backup service, export service, import service, media service and data-quality service candidates.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` reading rules so AI only reads these guardrail docs when the task touches runtime/export/import/media/backup/dependency/Worker concerns.
- Updated `docs/00_INDEX.md` with the two new docs.
- Updated `docs/02_ARCHITECTURE.md` with a short cross-reference and main Worker responsibility boundary.
- Updated `docs/07_PHASE_PLAN.md` with Phase 102B plus A/B boundary checkpoints for media/export/import/data-quality phases.
- Boundary: docs only, no migration, no DB apply, no deploy, no runtime code change, no Worker created, no package added, no push.
- Recommended next phase: apply these docs into the repo, then continue Phase 108-110 schema candidate design / static safety / approval gate.

## 2026-06-18 - Phase 103-107 Vietnamese Genealogy Domain Model Readiness completed

- Bundle 1 completed as docs/checker only.

- Added `npm run check:vietnamese-genealogy-domain`.
- Phase 103 documented Vietnamese genealogy domain concepts: `dong_ho`, `chi`, `nhanh`, `doi`, `the_he`, founder, clan head, branch head, spouse/child/adopted/step relationships, memorial and privacy needs.
- Phase 104 recorded current model strengths and gaps, classified as Required Now / Recommended Next / Later.
- Phase 105 specified Vietnamese person profile fields and public/private defaults.
- Phase 106 specified relationship rules, child ordering and conflict warnings.
- Phase 107 specified clan/branch/generation structure, tree filtering and export/import compatibility.
- Boundary: no migration, no DB apply, no deploy, no production data mutation, no runtime app change.
- Validation: env safe, migration order, domain checker, typecheck, lint and `git diff --check` PASS.
- Direct build hit known Windows `.next` EPERM artifact lock; isolated temp build PASS and temp artifacts/config rewrites were removed.

- `scripts/check-github-actions-opennext-gate.cjs`
- `npm run check:github-actions-opennext`
- `docs/15C_GITHUB_ACTIONS_OPENNEXT_BUILD_GATE.md`

### Env/secrets policy

- Workflow là build gate, không phải deploy.
- Workflow có placeholder env để build khi chưa cấu hình production secrets thật.
- Không dùng workflow này để smoke test Supabase thật.
- Production deploy phase sau mới cấu hình Cloudflare/GitHub secrets/env thật.

### Audit status

- `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` vẫn có advisory trong Next/OpenNext/Wrangler/PostCSS/esbuild/ws chain.
- Không chạy `npm audit fix --force`.
- Nếu checks/build PASS, Phase 15C được xem là READY_TO_RUN_ON_GITHUB với known audit advisories.

### Local validation

- Gate Phase 15B signs: PASS.
- `npm run check:github-actions-opennext`: PASS.
- `npm run check:opennext-cloudflare`: PASS.
- `npm run check:service-boundary`: PASS.
- `npm run typecheck`: PASS.
- `npm run lint`: PASS.
- `npm run build`: PASS.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`: PASS_WITH_KNOWN_AUDIT_ADVISORIES.
- Phase 15C status: READY_TO_RUN_ON_GITHUB.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Push commit lên GitHub để chạy OpenNext Cloudflare Build Gate. Nếu GitHub Actions PASS, tiếp tục Phase 15D - First Cloudflare Deploy Retry.

## 2026-06-16 - Phase 15B Service Boundary & Worker Split Readiness completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có service boundary readiness để tránh main Worker phình to về sau. Phase này chỉ tạo docs, template worker và checker; chưa tách Worker thật, chưa tạo Cloudflare service thật, chưa deploy, chưa upload, chưa push remote, không chạy migration và không đổi business logic.

### Boundary đã ghi nhận

- Main Web Worker giữ UI public/admin, auth callback, people CRUD nhẹ, relationship CRUD nhẹ, tree viewer/editor nhẹ và gọi service phụ khi cần.
- `export-backup-worker` tương lai xử lý `family.json`, GEDCOM, ZIP backup, checksum và scheduled/manual backup.
- `import-validate-worker` tương lai xử lý JSON parse, schema validation, missing reference validation, cycle check và conflict report; phase đầu không ghi DB.
- `media-worker` tương lai xử lý upload ảnh, resize/compress, metadata và media backup.
- `pdf-image-export-worker` tương lai xử lý xuất ảnh cây và PDF.

### File/script mới

- `docs/15_SERVICE_BOUNDARY_WORKER_SPLIT.md`
- `services/_template-worker/`
- `scripts/check-service-boundary-readiness.cjs`
- `npm run check:service-boundary`

### OpenNext/Windows note

- OpenNext wiring check PASS bằng `npm run check:opennext-cloudflare`.
- Next build PASS bằng `npm run build`.
- `npx.cmd opennextjs-cloudflare build` trên Windows thuần có thể bị BLOCKED bởi compatibility issue của OpenNext.
- Build/deploy thật nên chạy bằng WSL/Linux/GitHub Actions hoặc môi trường Cloudflare-compatible.

### Check status

- All project readiness/type/lint/build checks PASS.
- `npm.cmd audit --audit-level=moderate` FAIL vì advisory còn trong `next`/`postcss`, `@opennextjs/cloudflare`/`wrangler`/`esbuild`/`ws`.
- Không chạy `npm audit fix --force` vì ngoài scope, có advisory no-fix và force path có thể gây breaking downgrade.
- Phase 15B technical status: PASS.
- Commit status: allowed with audit exception.
- Audit status: npm audit still reports advisories in dependency/toolchain chain.
- Policy: no `npm audit fix --force`; track upstream package updates.
- Reason: current advisory remediation may require force/breaking changes and could destabilize Next/OpenNext deploy wiring.
- Kết luận validation: PASS_WITH_KNOWN_AUDIT_ADVISORIES.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 15C - GitHub Actions/WSL OpenNext Build Gate hoặc retry first Cloudflare deploy bằng môi trường Linux sau khi backup và production env/secrets đã sẵn sàng.

## 2026-06-16 - Phase 15A OpenNext Cloudflare Workers Wiring completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có wiring deploy rõ ràng cho Cloudflare Workers qua OpenNext. Phase này chỉ cài/cấu hình deploy adapter và docs/checker, chưa deploy thật, chưa upload, chưa push remote, không chạy migration, không sửa schema/auth/business logic và không đọc/in `.env.local`.

### File/script mới hoặc cập nhật

- `@opennextjs/cloudflare`
- `wrangler`
- `open-next.config.ts`
- `wrangler.toml`
- `eslint.config.mjs` ignores generated `.open-next` output
- `scripts/check-opennext-cloudflare-wiring.cjs`
- `docs/14_OPENNEXT_CLOUDFLARE_WIRING.md`
- `npm run check:opennext-cloudflare`
- `npm run preview`
- `npm run deploy`
- `npm run upload`
- `npm run cf-typegen`

### Deploy boundary

- Target: Cloudflare Workers via OpenNext.
- `npm run deploy`, `npm run upload` và `npx wrangler deploy` vẫn chưa được chạy.
- Trước khi retry Phase 15, cần backup `family.json` và `full-backup.zip`.
- Cần cấu hình Cloudflare variables/secrets: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` phải là secret/server-side, không dùng `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Chạy lại Phase 15 - First Cloudflare Deploy.

## 2026-06-16 - Phase 14 Deploy Readiness completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có deploy readiness baseline cho first Cloudflare deploy. Phase này chỉ tạo docs/check/script, không deploy thật, không push remote, không tạo Cloudflare project, không sửa schema/auth/business logic và không đọc/in `.env.local`.

### File/script mới

- `docs/13_DEPLOY_READINESS.md`
- `scripts/check-deploy-readiness.cjs`
- `npm run check:deploy-readiness`

### Deploy readiness policy

- Target deploy: Cloudflare, nhưng Pages versus Workers wiring cần xác nhận ở Phase 15.
- Production env bắt buộc: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`.
- `.env.example` chỉ giữ placeholder rỗng.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` chỉ server-side, không dùng `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
- Trước deploy cần cập nhật Supabase Site URL/Redirect URLs và Google OAuth Authorized JavaScript origin.
- Trước deploy có rủi ro dữ liệu cần tải `family.json` và `full-backup.zip`.

### Boundary giữ nguyên

- Không chạy lại migrations 0001-0006.
- Không tạo migration mới.
- Không bật import confirm thật.
- Không bật revision restore thật.
- Không deploy hoặc push remote.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 15 - First Cloudflare Deploy.

## 2026-06-16 - Phase 13 UI Polish Foundation completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có UI polish foundation trên các bề mặt chính. Phase này chỉ sửa giao diện/copy/layout và thêm checker, không sửa schema, RLS, auth callback, business logic dữ liệu, import confirm hoặc revision restore.

### UI primitives mới

- `components/ui/page-header.tsx`
- `components/ui/section-card.tsx`
- `components/ui/status-callout.tsx`
- `components/ui/empty-state.tsx`
- `components/ui/action-link.tsx`

### UI đã polish

- Admin shell: nav rõ hơn, active route rõ hơn, user/role/permission context gọn hơn.
- Public homepage/tree/profile: hero, CTA, readonly/public privacy copy.
- Login page: Google OAuth và magic link phân biệt rõ hơn.
- People list/form: bảng dễ đọc hơn, form chia nhóm thông tin.
- Relationships: giải thích family, cha mẹ/con, quan hệ đôi và UUID.
- Tree viewer/editor: toolbar rõ hơn, hướng dẫn click/kéo/lưu layout, empty state rõ hơn.
- Export/import: nhấn mạnh `family.json` là backup chính, import preview chưa ghi DB.

### Script check mới

- `npm run check:ui-polish`

### Boundary giữ nguyên

- Không tạo migration.
- Không chạy lại migrations 0001-0006.
- Không sửa auth callback/PKCE.
- Không bật import confirm thật.
- Không bật revision restore thật.
- Không deploy hoặc push remote.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 14 - Deploy Readiness hoặc Phase 14 - Import Confirm Planning, tùy ưu tiên.

## 2026-06-16 - Phase 12 Real Supabase Smoke Test Baseline completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có mốc baseline ổn định sau real Supabase smoke test. Phase 12 chỉ cập nhật tài liệu và report, không sửa code app, không tạo migration, không deploy và không push remote.

### File/report mới

- `docs/12_REAL_SUPABASE_SMOKE_TEST_REPORT.md`

### User-confirmed smoke status

- Google OAuth login: PASS.
- User đã thêm người thật vào database thật: PASS.
- Main routes/functions smoke test chính: OK theo xác nhận của user.
- PKCE issue trước đó: tự hết, xem như transient browser/cookie/origin issue nếu không tái diễn.

### Baseline policy

- Đây là baseline ổn định trước UI polish.
- Không chạy lại toàn bộ migration 0001-0006 sau khi đã có dữ liệu thật nếu chưa review schema/data state.
- Không bật import confirm thật nếu chưa có transaction, final validation, conflict resolution và log an toàn.
- Không bật revision restore thật nếu chưa có transaction, validation và revision mới cho hành động restore.

### Chưa làm

- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa làm import confirm thật.
- Chưa làm revision restore thật.
- Chưa ghi nhận per-route evidence độc lập từ Codex trong Phase 12; report dùng `PASS_USER_CONFIRMED` hoặc `NOT_CONFIRMED` đúng mức xác nhận.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 13 - UI Polish Foundation. Không ưu tiên import confirm thật ở bước kế tiếp.

## 2026-06-16 - Google OAuth login added

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có thêm đăng nhập Google OAuth qua Supabase Auth để tránh phụ thuộc hoàn toàn vào magic link khi gặp `email rate limit exceeded` hoặc `otp_expired`.

### File/route đã cập nhật

- `components/auth/login-form.tsx`
- `app/auth/login/page.tsx`
- `app/auth/callback/route.ts`
- `docs/10_SUPABASE_SETUP.md`

### Auth behavior

- `/auth/login` vẫn giữ form magic link.
- `/auth/login` có thêm nút `Đăng nhập với Google`, gọi Supabase `signInWithOAuth` với `redirectTo` là `${window.location.origin}/auth/callback`.
- `/auth/callback` xử lý cả magic link và Google OAuth bằng `exchangeCodeForSession(code)`.
- `/auth/callback` ưu tiên `error_code`/`error` trước khi kiểm tra thiếu `code`.
- Exchange lỗi redirect về `/auth/login?reason=auth_callback_failed` và chỉ log metadata an toàn: name, message, status/code.
- Callback thành công vẫn ưu tiên `/admin` khi user có `people.view`.

### Cấu hình thủ công còn cần user kiểm tra

- Google Cloud OAuth Client có Authorized redirect URI: `https://<SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`.
- Supabase Dashboard -> Authentication -> Providers -> Google đã Enabled và có Client ID/Secret.
- Supabase URL Configuration local có:
  - `http://localhost:3000/**`
  - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
- Khi deploy Cloudflare Pages, thêm redirect URL tương ứng cho `https://<pages-project>.pages.dev/**` và `/auth/callback`.

### Chưa làm

- Chưa tạo migration.
- Chưa sửa schema/role/OWNER.
- Chưa commit secret.
- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

User kiểm tra cấu hình Google Cloud/Supabase Dashboard rồi smoke test `/auth/login` bằng Google OAuth với tài khoản OWNER thật.

## 2026-06-16 - Phase 11 Supabase Integration & Real Smoke Test Gate completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có gate chuẩn bị tích hợp Supabase thật. Phase này không chạy migration thật, không deploy, không push và không commit secret.

### File/route/script đã có

- `docs/10_SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
- `docs/11_SMOKE_TEST_CHECKLIST.md`
- `scripts/check-env-safe.cjs`
- `scripts/check-migrations-order.cjs`
- `/admin/system/status`
- `npm run check:env:safe`
- `npm run check:migrations`

### Supabase integration behavior

- `.env.local` vẫn chỉ là file local, không commit.
- `check:env:safe` chỉ in trạng thái present/missing, không in giá trị secret.
- `check:migrations` kiểm migration folder, thứ tự tên file, đủ prefix `0001` đến `0006`, không duplicate prefix và không conflict marker.
- `/admin/system/status` yêu cầu `settings.manage` hoặc `permissions.manage`, chỉ hiển thị trạng thái env dạng yes/no và danh sách foundation checks.

### Chưa làm

- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa chạy migration thật trên Supabase.
- Chưa test login Supabase thật.
- Chưa gán OWNER thật.
- Chưa smoke test CRUD/export/import preview bằng user thật.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

User cấu hình `.env.local`, chạy migrations thật, đăng nhập lần đầu, gán OWNER bằng `db/snippets/assign-owner-role.sql`, rồi chạy checklist `docs/11_SMOKE_TEST_CHECKLIST.md`.

## 2026-06-15 - Phase 10 Import JSON Foundation completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có Import JSON foundation dạng preview an toàn. Admin có route `/admin/exports/import` để upload hoặc paste `family.json`, kiểm tra schema, quan hệ, vòng tổ tiên và conflict cơ bản với DB hiện tại.

### Import service/UI đã có

- `lib/family/import-types.ts`
- `lib/family/json-import-validator.ts`
- `lib/family/json-import-preview-service.ts`
- `app/(admin)/admin/exports/import/page.tsx`
- `app/(admin)/admin/exports/import/actions.ts`
- `components/imports/json-import-preview-form.tsx`

### Import behavior

- Hỗ trợ preview schema `1.0.0`.
- Validate JSON parse được, `schema_version`, `people`, `full_name`, duplicate person/family IDs, reference giữa family/person/layout và vòng tổ tiên.
- Conflict check DB nếu có Supabase/admin config và user có `imports.create`: existing person IDs, duplicate slugs, family IDs, tree layout IDs.
- Nếu thiếu Supabase config, route vẫn cho kiểm tra cấu trúc file và báo conflict DB unavailable an toàn.
- File/input giới hạn 5MB.
- Nút xác nhận import bị disabled; Phase 10 không ghi DB, không lưu file, không restore dữ liệu.

### Permission/privacy status

- Route import yêu cầu `imports.create` khi Supabase/auth đã cấu hình.
- Service role chỉ dùng server-side trong conflict check.
- Client form chỉ gọi server action, không nhận secret.
- Không tạo mock data, không ghi đè dữ liệu hiện tại.

### Script check đã tạo

- `npm run check:import-json`

### Chưa làm

- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa làm import thật.
- Chưa ghi import job/revision log cho thao tác import.
- Chưa có transaction import/rollback.
- Chưa kiểm thử với Supabase data thật.

### Lưu ý cho AI tiếp theo

- Không bật import thật nếu chưa có transaction, validation final, conflict resolution và revision/import log.
- Không overwrite person/family/layout theo ID cũ nếu chưa có chế độ xác nhận rõ ràng.
- `family.json` vẫn là bản bảo toàn dữ liệu chính; GEDCOM không thay thế được JSON.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 11 - Import transaction/restore planning hoặc UI polish foundation.

## 2026-06-15 - Phase 9 Revision History UI Foundation completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có Revision History UI foundation. Admin có thể xem danh sách revision, lọc cơ bản và mở chi tiết để xem before/after JSON cùng diff field.

### Revision service/UI đã có

- `lib/family/revision-types.ts`
- `lib/family/revision-service.ts`
- `lib/family/revision-diff.ts`
- `/admin/revisions`
- `/admin/revisions/[id]`

### Revision behavior

- `/admin/revisions` hiển thị thời gian, action, entity_type, entity_id, changed_by và reason.
- Filter hỗ trợ `entity_type`, `action`, `entity_id`, `changed_by`, `changed_from`, `changed_to`.
- `/admin/revisions/[id]` hiển thị metadata, diff field, `revision_items` nếu có và raw before/after JSON.
- `/admin/people/[id]` có link nhanh tới `/admin/revisions?entity_type=people&entity_id=<id>` nếu user có `revisions.view`.

### Restore status

- Phase 9 chưa làm restore thật.
- Nút restore là placeholder disabled.
- Người có `revisions.restore` chỉ thấy ghi chú rằng restore thật cần transaction, validation và revision mới.

### Permission/privacy status

- Service và route kiểm `revisions.view` server-side.
- Revision có thể chứa dữ liệu nhạy cảm trong `before_json`/`after_json`, không public.
- Không đưa service role key ra client.

### Script check đã tạo

- `npm run check:revisions`

### Lệnh đã chạy

- Baseline trước khi sửa: `npm run check:foundation`, `npm run check:auth-permissions`, `npm run check:people`, `npm run check:relationships`, `npm run check:tree-viewer`, `npm run check:tree-editor`, `npm run check:public-privacy`, `npm run check:export-backup`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Phase 9: `npm run check:revisions`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check` - PASS
- Browser route check `/admin/revisions`, `/admin/revisions/fake-id` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3000` - PASS; routes render nội dung an toàn, không crash trắng.
- `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` - WARN, còn 2 moderate warnings từ `next`/`postcss`; không chạy force fix vì breaking change ngoài scope.

### Chưa làm

- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa làm restore thật.
- Chưa có transaction/validation restore.
- Chưa kiểm thử với dữ liệu Supabase thật.
- NPM audit còn 2 moderate warnings từ `next`/`postcss`.

### Lưu ý cho AI tiếp theo

- Không bật restore thật nếu chưa có validation, transaction và revision log cho hành động restore.
- Revision detail có thể hiển thị dữ liệu nhạy cảm nên không đưa ra public route.
- Nếu mở restore, phải xử lý từng `entity_type` riêng, không dùng generic overwrite mù.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 10 - Import JSON foundation hoặc UI polish foundation.

## 2026-06-15 - Phase 8 Export/backup foundation completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có export/backup foundation. Admin có route `/admin/exports` để tải `family.json`, `family.ged` và `full-backup.zip`.

### Export/backup service đã có

- `lib/family/export-types.ts`
- `lib/family/export-collector.ts`
- `lib/family/json-exporter.ts`
- `lib/family/gedcom-exporter.ts`
- `lib/family/checksum.ts`
- `lib/family/zip-backup-exporter.ts`

### Route đã có

- `/admin/exports`: trang admin backup/export.
- `/admin/exports/download/json`: tải `family.json`.
- `/admin/exports/download/gedcom`: tải `family.ged`.
- `/admin/exports/download/zip`: tải `full-backup.zip`.

### Database migration đã có

- `db/migrations/20260614_0006_export_backup_foundation.sql`
- Bảng `export_jobs`: metadata job export.
- Bảng `backup_records`: metadata backup dài hạn.
- RLS: `exports.download` đọc record, `exports.create` tạo record.
- Chưa chạy migration trên Supabase thật.

### Export status

- `family.json`: đã build từ people, families, family_parents, family_children, couple_relationships, tree_layouts và tree_layout_nodes.
- `family.ged`: foundation GEDCOM với HEAD/INDI/FAM/TRLR.
- `full-backup.zip`: dùng `jszip`, gồm `family.json`, `family.ged`, `manifest.json`, `checksums.json`.
- Manifest/checksum: schema version `1.0.0`, app version `0.1.0`, SHA-256.
- Media: chưa có media upload thật, `media_count = 0`.
- Import: chưa bật import ghi dữ liệu; chỉ giữ nguyên tắc docs.

### Permission/privacy status

- Download routes kiểm `exports.download` server-side.
- Export admin/internal có thể chứa dữ liệu đầy đủ theo quyền; không dùng làm public export.
- Nếu sau này cần public export, phải dùng privacy service/DTO public-safe.
- Không đưa service role key ra client.

### Script check đã tạo

- `npm run check:export-backup`

### Lệnh đã chạy

- Baseline trước khi sửa: `npm run check:foundation`, `npm run check:auth-permissions`, `npm run check:people`, `npm run check:relationships`, `npm run check:tree-viewer`, `npm run check:tree-editor`, `npm run check:public-privacy`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Phase 8: `npm run check:export-backup`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check` - PASS
- Browser route check `/admin/exports`, `/admin/exports/download/json`, `/admin/exports/download/gedcom`, `/admin/exports/download/zip` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3001` - PASS; download routes trả lỗi cấu hình an toàn khi thiếu Supabase config.
- `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` - WARN, còn 2 moderate warnings từ `next`/`postcss`; không chạy force fix vì breaking change ngoài scope.

### Chưa làm

- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa chạy migration trên Supabase thật.
- Chưa ghi `export_jobs`/`backup_records` vào DB runtime.
- Chưa làm import đầy đủ.
- Chưa làm media upload thật.
- Chưa làm export ảnh cây/PDF.
- Chưa kiểm thử với dữ liệu Supabase thật.
- NPM audit còn 2 moderate warnings từ `next`/`postcss`.

### Lưu ý cho AI tiếp theo

- Không bật import ghi dữ liệu nếu chưa có validation, preview, xác nhận và revision/import log.
- Không dùng admin export làm public export.
- Không bỏ `family.json`; GEDCOM không thay thế được JSON vì không giữ đủ dữ liệu riêng của hệ thống.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 9 - Revision history UI foundation.

## 2026-06-15 - Phase 7 Public/private mode foundation completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có public/private foundation. Public routes dùng privacy service và public-safe DTO, không đưa dữ liệu admin/private thẳng ra client.

### Public/privacy service đã có

- `lib/privacy/privacy-types.ts`
- `lib/privacy/privacy-service.ts`
- `lib/family/public-family-service.ts`

Privacy service có:

- `canShowPersonInMode`
- `toPublicPerson`
- `toFamilyPerson`
- `toAdminPerson`
- `sanitizePersonForMode`
- `sanitizeTreeGraphForMode`

### Public routes đã có

- `/`: public homepage.
- `/tree`: public readonly tree.
- `/people/[slug]`: public-safe person profile.
- `/admin/preview/public`: admin preview mô phỏng public tree.

### Public privacy behavior

- Public mode chỉ hiện người `visibility = public` và chưa xóa mềm.
- `PublicPerson` không có `notes_private`.
- Người còn sống public không hiện ngày sinh đầy đủ, ngày mất, nơi sinh, quê quán, ghi chú riêng tư hoặc dữ liệu nội bộ.
- Public tree được sanitize server-side trước khi truyền vào React Flow viewer.
- Admin preview dùng cùng public service với `/tree`.

### RLS/public query limitation

- Phase 7 không mở RLS public rộng.
- Public service dùng server-side anon Supabase client với query/filter `visibility = public`, `deleted_at is null`.
- Nếu database thật chưa có public-safe RLS policy, public routes có thể empty hoặc báo lỗi an toàn.
- Không dùng service role để build public pages trong Phase 7.

### Script check đã tạo

- `npm run check:public-privacy`

### Lệnh đã chạy

- Baseline: `npm run check:foundation`, `npm run check:auth-permissions`, `npm run check:people`, `npm run check:relationships`, `npm run check:tree-viewer`, `npm run check:tree-editor`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Phase 7: `npm run check:public-privacy`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Browser route check `/`, `/tree`, `/people/test-slug`, `/admin/preview/public` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3001` - PASS; các route render nội dung an toàn khi thiếu Supabase config.

### Chưa làm

- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa kiểm thử public routes với Supabase data thật.
- Chưa tạo public RLS policy/view/function riêng.
- Chưa làm export JSON/GEDCOM/ZIP thật.
- Chưa làm export ảnh/PDF.
- Chưa làm media upload thật.
- NPM audit còn 2 moderate warnings từ `next`/`postcss`.

### Lưu ý cho AI tiếp theo

- Không đưa `notes_private` vào public DTO.
- Không dựa vào CSS/UI để ẩn dữ liệu riêng tư.
- Nếu mở RLS public sau này, phải audit rất kỹ chỉ public-safe fields.
- Public tree/profile hiện dùng anon client; nếu DB policy chưa mở, fail/empty là expected-safe behavior.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 8 - Export/backup foundation:

- JSON export/import foundation.
- GEDCOM/ZIP planning hoặc export foundation.
- Không bỏ qua privacy/permission khi export.

## 2026-06-15 - Phase 6 Tree Editor foundation completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có Tree Editor foundation trong admin. Editor dùng React Flow, side panel và server actions để lưu layout UI riêng hoặc thêm quan hệ qua service thật.

### Migration/layout persistence đã tạo

- Migration: `db/migrations/20260614_0005_tree_layout_foundation.sql`
- Bảng `tree_layouts`: lưu layout tree theo scope.
- Bảng `tree_layout_nodes`: lưu vị trí node thủ công.
- RLS: `tree.view` đọc layout chưa xóa mềm, `tree.edit_layout` tạo/sửa/xóa mềm layout.
- Layout là dữ liệu UI, không thay thế relationship tables.

### Tree editor đã có

- Route: `/admin/tree/edit`
- Actions: `app/(admin)/admin/tree/edit/actions.ts`
- Layout service: `lib/family/tree-layout-service.ts`
- Components:
  - `components/tree/family-tree-editor.tsx`
  - `components/tree/tree-editor-side-panel.tsx`
  - `components/tree/tree-editor-toolbar.tsx`
- `/admin/tree` vẫn readonly và chỉ thêm link `Chỉnh sửa cây` khi có `tree.edit_layout`.

### Side panel/action status

- Click person node mở side panel.
- Side panel hiển thị họ tên, năm sinh/mất, đời, chi/nhánh, link hồ sơ và quan hệ tóm tắt.
- Có form thêm cha/mẹ, vợ/chồng/bạn đời, con bằng UUID người đã tồn tại.
- Add relationship từ cây dùng relationship service thật.
- Không tạo người mới từ cây trong Phase 6.

### Permission/privacy status

- `/admin/tree/edit` yêu cầu `tree.view` và `tree.edit_layout`.
- Save/reset layout yêu cầu `tree.edit_layout`.
- Add relationship yêu cầu `relationships.create` trong relationship service.
- Client editor không import service role/admin helper.
- Public tree chưa làm.

### Script check đã tạo

- `npm run check:tree-editor`

### Lệnh đã chạy

- Baseline: `npm run check:foundation`, `npm run check:auth-permissions`, `npm run check:people`, `npm run check:relationships`, `npm run check:tree-viewer`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Phase 6: `npm run check:tree-editor`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Browser route check `/admin/tree` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3001` - PASS, hiển thị thiếu cấu hình an toàn khi chưa có Supabase env thật.
- Browser route check `/admin/tree/edit` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3001` - PASS, hiển thị thiếu cấu hình an toàn khi chưa có Supabase env thật.

### Chưa làm

- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa chạy migration trên database thật.
- Chưa kiểm thử editor với Supabase data thật.
- Chưa làm public tree.
- Chưa export ảnh cây/PDF.
- Chưa làm JSON/GEDCOM/ZIP export thật.
- NPM audit còn 2 moderate warnings từ `next`/`postcss`.

### Lưu ý cho AI tiếp theo

- Không trộn layout tree với relationship data.
- Kéo node và lưu layout chỉ ghi `tree_layout_nodes`.
- Add relationship từ cây hiện tạo family unit nền rồi nối người đã tồn tại bằng UUID.
- Nếu thiếu Supabase env thật, `/admin/tree` và `/admin/tree/edit` phải fail an toàn, không dùng mock data.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 7 - Public/private mode foundation:

- Tạo public/internal surfaces.
- Lọc dữ liệu người còn sống và visibility server-side.
- Không chỉ ẩn dữ liệu private bằng UI.

## 2026-06-15 - Phase 5 Tree Viewer foundation completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có Tree Viewer foundation trong admin. Viewer dùng graph được build từ dữ liệu thật trong `people` và relationship tables, chưa có tree editor hoặc layout persistence.

### Package đã thêm

- `@xyflow/react`
- `elkjs`

### Tree graph/viewer đã có

- Types: `lib/family/tree-types.ts`
- Graph builder: `lib/family/tree-graph-builder.ts`
- Tree service: `lib/family/tree-service.ts`
- ELK layout helper: `lib/family/tree-layout-elk.ts`
- Route: `/admin/tree`
- Components:
  - `components/tree/family-tree-viewer.tsx`
  - `components/tree/family-node-card.tsx`
  - `components/tree/family-tree-toolbar.tsx`
  - `components/tree/family-tree-empty-state.tsx`
  - `components/tree/family-tree-error-state.tsx`

### Graph model

- Node kind: `person`, `family`.
- Edge kind: `family_unit`, `parent_child`, `couple`.
- Family node trung gian gom cha/mẹ và con.
- Node person không chứa `notes_private`.
- Builder có mode `admin`, `internal`, `public`; Phase 5 chỉ dùng admin route.

### Permission/privacy status

- `/admin/tree` yêu cầu `tree.view`.
- Tree service query server-side và trả graph đã build cho client viewer.
- Client viewer không import service role/admin helper.
- Public tree chưa làm trong Phase 5.

### Script check đã tạo

- `npm run check:tree-viewer`

### Lệnh đã chạy

- Baseline: `npm run check:foundation`, `npm run check:auth-permissions`, `npm run check:people`, `npm run check:relationships`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Phase 5: `npm run check:tree-viewer`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Browser route check `/admin/tree` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3001` - PASS, hiển thị thiếu cấu hình an toàn khi chưa có Supabase env thật.

### Chưa làm

- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa kiểm thử viewer với Supabase data thật.
- Chưa làm Tree Editor.
- Chưa lưu layout thủ công.
- Chưa làm public tree.
- Chưa export ảnh cây/PDF.
- Chưa làm export JSON/GEDCOM/ZIP thật.
- NPM audit còn 2 moderate warnings sau khi cài package.

### Lưu ý cho AI tiếp theo

- Không trộn dữ liệu layout cây với dữ liệu quan hệ thật.
- Tree editor/mutation từ cây là Phase 6, chưa có trong viewer.
- Nếu thiếu Supabase env thật, `/admin/tree` phải fail an toàn, không dùng mock data.
- Public tree cần lọc visibility server-side, không chỉ ẩn bằng UI.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 6 - Tree Editor foundation:

- Thêm edit interactions qua service/action có permission rõ ràng.
- Nếu lưu layout, dùng bảng `tree_layouts`, `tree_layout_nodes`, `tree_layout_edges` riêng.
- Không coi kéo node là sửa quan hệ gia phả thật.

## 2026-06-15 - Phase 4 Relationship CRUD foundation completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có Relationship CRUD foundation trong admin. Relationship data được lưu trong bảng riêng, có permission server-side, RLS, soft delete, revision và cycle check cơ bản.

### Relationship schema đã tạo

- Migration: `db/migrations/20260614_0004_relationship_foundation.sql`
- Bảng `families`: nhóm family với `family_code`, `family_label`, `visibility`, notes, audit và soft delete fields.
- Bảng `family_parents`: nối family với cha/mẹ/người nuôi bằng `parent_role` và `relationship_type`.
- Bảng `family_children`: nối family với con bằng `child_relationship_type`.
- Bảng `couple_relationships`: lưu quan hệ đôi với `relationship_status`, ngày bắt đầu/kết thúc, `visibility`, notes, audit và soft delete fields.

### Service/UI đã có

- `lib/family/relationship-service.ts`: list, summary theo person, create family, add parent/child, create/update couple, soft delete relationship records.
- `lib/family/relationship-graph.ts`: cycle check cha-con cơ bản.
- `lib/family/revision-service.ts`: helper revision dùng chung.
- `/admin/relationships`: danh sách family/couple, form tạo family, thêm cha/mẹ/con, tạo quan hệ đôi.
- `/admin/people/[id]`: có section Quan hệ gia đình.
- Admin nav có link `Quan hệ gia đình`.

### RLS/permission status

- Bật RLS cho `families`, `family_parents`, `family_children`, `couple_relationships`.
- `relationships.view` xem bản ghi chưa xóa mềm.
- `relationships.create` insert.
- `relationships.update`/`relationships.delete` update hoặc xóa mềm.
- Service layer vẫn enforce action-specific permission trước từng mutation.
- Không mở public-wide policy cho relationship tables.

### Script check đã tạo

- `npm run check:relationships`

### Lệnh đã chạy

- Baseline: `npm run check:foundation`, `npm run check:auth-permissions`, `npm run check:people`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Phase 4: `npm run check:relationships`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` - PASS
- Browser route check `/admin/relationships` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3001` - PASS
- Browser route check `/admin/people/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3001` - PASS
- `git diff --check` - PASS

### Chưa làm

- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa chạy migration trên database thật.
- Chưa kiểm thử Relationship CRUD với Supabase project thật.
- Chưa làm tree viewer/editor.
- Chưa cài React Flow/ELK trong Phase 4.
- Chưa làm public family tree.
- Chưa làm media upload thật.
- Chưa làm export JSON/GEDCOM/ZIP thật.

### Lưu ý cho AI tiếp theo

- Không thêm `father_id`, `mother_id`, `spouse_id` vào `people`.
- Relationship UI hiện nhập UUID trực tiếp, chưa có autocomplete.
- Nếu thiếu Supabase env thật, relationship routes phải fail an toàn, không dùng mock data.
- Tree viewer/editor và layout graph là phase sau, không nằm trong Phase 4.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 5 - Tree viewer foundation:

- Đọc relationship tables để dựng dữ liệu cây.
- Chỉ cài React Flow/ELK khi phase tree cho phép.
- Không trộn dữ liệu layout cây với dữ liệu quan hệ thật.

## 2026-06-15 - Phase 3 People CRUD foundation completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có nền quản lý thành viên trong admin. Các route People CRUD foundation đã được tạo, dùng permission server-side và soft delete, chưa làm quan hệ gia đình hoặc cây gia phả.

### People schema đã tạo

- Migration: `db/migrations/20260614_0003_people_foundation.sql`
- Bảng `people` gồm identity, birth/death, place/branch, content/privacy, audit và soft delete fields.
- `visibility`: `public`, `family`, `private`.
- `gender`: `male`, `female`, `other`, `unknown`.
- Date precision: `exact`, `year_month`, `year`, `approximate`, `unknown`.

### Soft delete rule

- Không xóa cứng.
- Soft delete dùng `deleted_at`, `deleted_by`, `delete_reason`.
- Restore xóa các field soft-delete và ghi revision restore.

### Revision status

- Tạo foundation `revisions` và `revision_items`.
- People service ghi revision tối thiểu cho create/update/delete/restore với `before_json`, `after_json`, `changed_by`, `change_reason`.
- Chưa làm UI revision history hoặc restore revision nâng cao.

### RLS status

- Bật RLS cho `people`, `revisions`, `revision_items`.
- `people.view` xem bản ghi chưa xóa mềm.
- `people.create` insert.
- Update policy cho người có `people.update`, `people.delete`, hoặc `people.restore`.
- Service layer vẫn enforce action-specific permission trước từng mutation.
- Không mở public-wide policy cho `people`.

### CRUD route đã có

- `/admin/people`: danh sách, search, filter visibility/is_living.
- `/admin/people/new`: form thêm thành viên.
- `/admin/people/[id]`: xem/sửa, soft delete, restore.

### Script check đã tạo

- `npm run check:people`

### Lệnh đã chạy

- `npm run check:foundation` - PASS
- `npm run check:auth-permissions` - PASS
- `npm run check:people` - PASS
- `npm run typecheck` - PASS
- `npm run lint` - PASS
- `npm run build` - PASS
- Browser route check `/admin/people`, `/admin/people/new`, `/admin/people/[id]` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3001` - PASS

### Chưa làm

- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa chạy migration trên database thật.
- Chưa kiểm thử CRUD với Supabase project thật.
- Chưa làm Relationship CRUD.
- Chưa tạo `families`, `family_parents`, `family_children`, `couple_relationships`.
- Chưa làm cây gia phả.
- Chưa làm media upload thật.
- Chưa làm export JSON/GEDCOM/ZIP thật.

### Lưu ý cho AI tiếp theo

- Không xóa cứng people.
- Không thêm relationship vào `people`.
- Relationship CRUD phải dùng bảng quan hệ riêng ở phase sau.
- Service role vẫn chỉ dùng server-side.
- Nếu chưa có Supabase env thật, People UI phải fail an toàn, không dùng mock data.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 4 - Relationship CRUD foundation:

- Tạo `families`, `family_parents`, `family_children`, `couple_relationships`.
- Gắn permissions `relationships.*`.
- Kiểm tra vòng lặp dữ liệu cơ bản.
- Không làm React Flow/ELK tree viewer nếu chưa sang phase cây.

## 2026-06-14 - Phase 2 Auth + Role Permission hardening completed

### Trạng thái hiện tại

Dự án WEB GIA PHẢ đã có auth/permission foundation server-side. Route `/admin` không còn là placeholder mở; route này yêu cầu user đăng nhập và có permission `people.view`.

### Auth flow đã chọn

- Supabase magic link theo email.
- Login UI tối giản tại `/auth/login`.
- Callback tại `/auth/callback`.
- Logout tại `/auth/logout`.
- Nếu thiếu cấu hình Supabase, login page hiển thị cảnh báo thay vì crash trắng.

### OWNER bootstrap đã chọn

- Không auto OWNER.
- User mới chỉ được bootstrap profile, không tự động có role admin.
- OWNER cần gán thủ công bằng SQL/admin context.
- Snippet: `db/snippets/assign-owner-role.sql`.

### Permission/admin guard

- Permission service server-side:
  - `lib/permissions/permission-service.ts`
  - `lib/permissions/require-permission.ts`
- Profile bootstrap:
  - `lib/auth/profile-service.ts`
- Quyền tối thiểu vào `/admin`: `people.view`.
- Nếu chưa đăng nhập: redirect `/auth/login`.
- Nếu đăng nhập nhưng thiếu quyền: redirect `/unauthorized`.

### Migration đã tạo

- `db/migrations/20260614_0002_auth_permission_hardening.sql`

Migration bổ sung:

- Bật lại RLS cho bảng nền.
- Recreate helper functions `current_profile_id()` và `has_permission(permission_code text)`.
- Cho authenticated user insert/update profile của chính mình.
- Cho user đọc role assignment và role permissions của chính mình.
- Thêm policy quản lý roles/permissions cho người có `permissions.manage`.
- Không mở public rộng cho bảng nhạy cảm.

### Script check đã tạo

- `npm run check:auth-permissions`

### Lệnh đã chạy

- `npm run check:foundation` - PASS
- `npm run check:auth-permissions` - PASS
- `npm run typecheck` - PASS
- `npm run lint` - PASS
- `npm run build` - PASS
- Browser route check `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`, `/unauthorized`, `/admin` trên `http://127.0.0.1:3001` - PASS

### Chưa làm

- Chưa push remote.
- Chưa deploy Cloudflare.
- Chưa tạo `.env` thật.
- Chưa kết nối Supabase project thật.
- Chưa chạy migration trên database thật.
- Chưa kiểm thử magic link với Supabase project thật.
- Chưa làm People CRUD.
- Chưa làm Relationship CRUD.
- Chưa làm cây gia phả.
- Chưa làm export JSON/GEDCOM/ZIP thật.

### Lưu ý cho AI tiếp theo

- Không đưa `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` vào client.
- Không tự động cấp OWNER nếu chưa có quyết định mới.
- `/admin` đang dùng `people.view` làm quyền vào cổng quản trị.
- Nếu cần OWNER đầu tiên, dùng `db/snippets/assign-owner-role.sql` sau khi profile đã tồn tại.
- Route guard và permission helper là server-side; không thay bằng kiểm tra UI.

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 3 - People CRUD foundation:

- Tạo schema people theo docs.
- Xóa mềm/khôi phục, không xóa cứng.
- List/profile/search/filter thành viên.
- Gắn permission `people.*` vào service layer và UI.
- Không làm quan hệ/cây nếu chưa sang phase sau.

## 2026-06-14 - Phase 1 Project foundation completed

### Task tiếp theo đề xuất

Phase 2 - Auth + Role Permission hardening:

- Kết nối Supabase project thật qua `.env`.
- Hoàn thiện login/logout thật.
- Tạo profile sau đăng nhập.
- Siết RLS/policy theo role permission.
- Thêm kiểm tra schema/permission chi tiết hơn.
